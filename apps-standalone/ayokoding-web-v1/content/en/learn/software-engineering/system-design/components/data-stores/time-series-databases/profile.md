## **Introduction**

Time-series databases are designed to handle large amounts of data that are time-stamped. They are optimized for storing and querying time-series data, which makes them ideal for use cases such as IoT, financial data, and log data.

## **Key Characteristics**

- Structured data
- Optimized for time-series data
- High write throughput
- Efficient storage and retrieval of time-series data
- Support for complex queries
- Limited support for transactions and joins

## **CAP Theorem**

### **General CAP theorem handling**

Time-series databases typically prioritize availability and partition tolerance over consistency.

### **Guarantee of consistency**

- Eventual consistency is typically used in time-series databases.
- The database achieves eventual consistency using vector clocks and conflict resolution techniques.

### **Guarantee of availability**

- Time-series databases are designed to be highly available.
- They achieve availability through techniques such as replication and sharding.

### **Guarantee of partition tolerance**

- Time-series databases are designed to be highly partition tolerant.
- They achieve partition tolerance through techniques such as replication and sharding.

## **Usage**

### **Best usage**

- Time-series databases are best suited for storing and querying time-series data.
- They are ideal for use cases like IoT, financial, and log data.

### **Neutral usage**

- Time-series databases can also be used for storing and querying non-time-series data.
- However, they may not be the best choice for non-time-series data use cases.

### **Worst usage**

Time-series databases are unsuited for use cases requiring complex transactions or join.

### **System Design Role**

- Time-series databases are well-suited for systems that require efficient storage and retrieval of time-series data.
- They are ideal for systems that require high write throughput and support for complex queries.

## **Data Model**

- Time-series databases typically use a non-relational data model.
- The data is organized into time series, which are collections of time-stamped data points.
- The advantages of the data model include efficient storage and retrieval of time-series data.
- The disadvantages of the data model include limited support for transactions and join.

## **Query Language**

- Time-series databases typically use a NoSQL query language.
- The query language is optimized for querying time-series data.
- The advantages of the query language include efficient querying of time-series data.
- The disadvantages of the query language include limited support for transactions and join.

## **Scalability**

### **How to make it performant**

Time-series databases can be made performant through techniques such as indexing and compression.

### **High traffic handling**

Time-series databases are well-suited for high-write workloads. They can also handle high-read workloads but may require additional resources.

### **How to scale it**

Time-series databases can be scaled horizontally through techniques such as sharding. Vertical scaling may also be an option but may be limited by hardware constraints.

### Usage in distributed systems

Time-series databases can be used in distributed systems. Considerations include data partitioning, replication, and consistency.

### Replication

- Time-series databases typically use replication to achieve high availability and partition tolerance.
- Best practices for replication include using multiple replicas and ensuring consistency across replicas.

## In Practice

### Best Practices

Best practices for using time-series databases include optimizing queries, using compression, and monitoring performance.

### Common Pitfalls

Common pitfalls to avoid when using time-series databases include not optimizing queries, not using compression, and not monitoring performance.
