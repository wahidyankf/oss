# How to Create Great Self-Review

A self-review is an essential part of the performance review process. It is an opportunity for employees to reflect on their accomplishments, identify areas for improvement, and communicate their goals and aspirations to their managers. A well-written self-review can help managers better understand their employees' strengths and weaknesses and provide valuable insights into their performance.

Here are some tips on how to create an excellent self-review for your performance review:

### **1. Start with a Positive Attitude**

Approach your self-review with a positive attitude. This is your chance to showcase your accomplishments and highlight your strengths. Don't be overly critical of yourself, but also be modest. Be honest and objective in your assessment of your performance.

### **2. Review Your Goals**

Review the goals you set for yourself at the beginning of the performance period. Have you achieved them? If not, what progress have you made? Be specific and provide examples of how you have worked towards achieving your goals.

### **3. Highlight Your Accomplishments**

Highlight your accomplishments over the performance period. Be specific and provide examples of how you have contributed to the success of your team or organization. Use data and metrics to support your claims.

### **4. Identify Areas for Improvement**

Identify areas where you can improve. Be honest and objective in your assessment of your weaknesses. Provide examples of how you plan to address these areas and what steps you have taken to improve.

### **5. Communicate Your Goals and Aspirations**

Communicate your goals and aspirations to your manager. What do you want to achieve in the next performance period? What skills do you want to develop? What opportunities do you want to pursue? Be specific and provide examples of how you plan to achieve your goals.

### **6. Use the STAR Method**

Use the STAR method to structure your self-review. STAR stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result. Start by describing the situation or task you faced, then describe the action you took to address it, and finally, describe the result of your actions. This method provides a clear and concise way to communicate your accomplishments.

### **7. Be Concise**

Be concise in your self-review. Stick to the key points and avoid rambling. Use bullet points to break up your review and make it easier to read.
