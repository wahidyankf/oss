As a frontend engineer preparing for interviews, mastering key technical areas is essential for success. Based on research into effective interview-focused learning approaches for software engineers and verified interview topic lists, I've compiled this comprehensive guide to the most important topics to master for frontend engineering interviews, including specialized technical sections for senior, staff, and higher-level positions.

## 1. Core Frontend Technologies

### HTML

- Semantic HTML structure and best practices
- HTML5 features (canvas, local storage, web workers)
- Element types: block vs. inline vs. inline-block
- Document structure and metadata elements
- Accessibility attributes and ARIA roles
- SEO considerations in markup

**Why This Matters**: HTML forms the foundation of every web application. Interviewers assess your understanding of semantic markup because it impacts accessibility, SEO, and overall document structure. Knowledge of modern HTML5 features demonstrates your ability to leverage the platform for enhanced functionality without unnecessary JavaScript. According to the research, "knowledge gaps lead to inefficiency, poor decision-making, and missed opportunities in software engineering," and strong HTML knowledge prevents such gaps at the most fundamental level.

### CSS

- Box model (margin, padding, border, content)
- CSS specificity and the cascade
- Selectors and their performance implications

- CSS animations and transitions
- CSS architecture methodologies (BEM, SMACSS, OOCSS)
- CSS preprocessors (SASS, LESS)

**Why This Matters**: CSS mastery distinguishes frontend engineers who can create truly responsive, maintainable interfaces from those who rely on frameworks as a crutch. Interviewers evaluate your CSS knowledge to gauge your ability to solve layout challenges, implement responsive designs, and optimize performance. Deep understanding of CSS fundamentals like the cascade and specificity indicates your ability to write clean, efficient styles and debug styling issues effectively. Research shows that "scenario-based learning promotes learner engagement, decision-making, and critical thinking," and CSS interviews often present scenario-based challenges that test these skills.
