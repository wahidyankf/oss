This comprehensive guide contains essential questions covering the core technical knowledge required for backend engineering interviews. Each question includes an explanation of why the topic matters, clarifying questions to ask during interviews, solution steps, and both best practices and anti-patterns to demonstrate comprehensive understanding. The guide covers traditional backend concepts while incorporating emerging technologies and modern architectural patterns.

## Core Backend Technologies

### 1. Explain the difference between process and thread in operating systems.

**Why It Matters**: Understanding fundamental OS concepts directly impacts how you design concurrent applications. Engineers who grasp these differences make better architectural decisions about resource utilization, application performance, and fault isolation.

**Clarifying Questions**:

- Are we focusing on performance considerations or application architecture?

**Solution Steps**:

1. Define processes as independent execution units with separate memory spaces
2. Explain threads as lighter execution units that share memory within a process
3. Compare resource allocation differences (memory, file handles)
4. Discuss context switching costs between processes vs threads
5. Explain thread safety concerns with shared memory

**Best Practices**:

- Use processes for fault isolation and security boundaries
- Use threads for concurrent tasks that need to share data
- Consider the thread pool pattern for managing thread creation overhead
