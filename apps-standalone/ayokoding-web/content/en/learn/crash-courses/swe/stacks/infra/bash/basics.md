Hey there! Let's dive into Bash, the powerful command-line interface that'll make you feel like a computer wizard. By the end of this crash course, you'll be comfortable with 85% of what you need for daily use, and I'll point you toward the exciting 15% you can explore on your own.

## What is Bash and Why Should You Care?

Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a command-line interface for Unix-like operating systems. Think of it as a text-based way to talk directly to your computerâ€”no clicking required! Bash comes pre-installed on macOS and Linux, and you can get it on Windows through WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or Git Bash.

Why learn Bash?

- **Efficiency**: Tasks that would take multiple clicks can be done with a single command
- **Automation**: You can script repetitive tasks
- **Remote work**: Manage servers without a GUI
- **Developer street cred**: Seriously, it's an essential skill

## Getting Started: Opening the Terminal

- **On macOS**: Press `Cmd+Space`, type "Terminal", and hit Enter
- **On Linux**: Usually `Ctrl+Alt+T`
- **On Windows**: Install WSL from the Microsoft Store, or install Git Bash

When you open the terminal, you'll see something like this:

```
username@hostname:~$
```

That `$` is your prompt, waiting for commands. Let's give it some!

## Essential Navigation Commands

```bash
pwd                 # Print Working Directory - shows where you are
ls                  # List files and directories
ls -la              # List all files (including hidden ones) with details
cd Documents        # Change Directory to Documents
cd ..               # Go up one directory
cd ~                # Go to home directory
cd /                # Go to root directory
clear               # Clear the terminal screen (or Ctrl+L)
```

Try out these commands to navigate around. For example:

```bash
$ pwd
/home/username
$ ls
Documents  Downloads  Pictures  Music
$ cd Documents
$ pwd
/home/username/Documents
$ cd ..
$ pwd
/home/username
```

## Working with Files and Directories

```bash
mkdir Projects      # Create a directory named Projects
touch file.txt      # Create an empty file
cp file.txt copy.txt  # Copy a file
mv file.txt newname.txt  # Rename a file
mv file.txt ~/Documents/  # Move a file to Documents directory
rm file.txt         # Remove (delete) a file
rm -r Projects      # Remove a directory and all its contents
cat file.txt        # Display file contents
less file.txt       # View file contents with pagination (q to quit)
head -n 5 file.txt  # Show first 5 lines
tail -n 5 file.txt  # Show last 5 lines
```

Let's try creating a simple directory structure:

```bash
$ mkdir Projects
$ cd Projects
$ mkdir WebApp
$ touch WebApp/index.html
$ touch WebApp/style.css
$ ls WebApp
index.html style.css
```

## Viewing and Editing Files

You can edit files right in the terminal:

```bash
nano file.txt       # Simple text editor
vim file.txt        # More powerful text editor (press i to insert, Esc then :wq to save and quit)
```

For viewing file content:

```bash
$ echo "Hello Bash World" > hello.txt  # Create file with content
$ cat hello.txt                        # View content
Hello Bash World
```

## Powerful Pipes and Redirection

Bash lets you connect commands like LEGO bricks:

```bash
# Redirect output to a file (overwrites existing content)
echo "Line one" > file.txt

# Append output to a file
echo "Line two" >> file.txt

# Pipe output from one command to another
cat file.txt | grep "one"  # Find lines containing "one"

# Save command output to a file
ls -la > files_list.txt
```

Example:

```bash
$ echo "First line" > sample.txt
$ echo "Second line" >> sample.txt
$ echo "Third line with the word example" >> sample.txt
$ cat sample.txt | grep "example"
Third line with the word example
```

## Finding Things

```bash
find . -name "*.txt"  # Find all .txt files in current directory and subdirectories
grep "search term" file.txt  # Search for text in a file
grep -r "search" .   # Search recursively through all files
```

Example usage:

```bash
$ find . -name "*.html"
./WebApp/index.html
$ echo "This is a sample" > sample.txt
$ grep "sample" sample.txt
This is a sample
```

## Bash Scripting Basics

Let's create a simple script:

```bash
$ touch my_script.sh
$ chmod +x my_script.sh  # Make it executable
```

Now edit with nano:

```bash
$ nano my_script.sh
```

Add this content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# My first bash script

echo "Hello, what's your name?"
read name
echo "Nice to meet you, $name!"
echo "Today is $(date)"
```

Run it:

```bash
$ ./my_script.sh
Hello, what's your name?
Alice
Nice to meet you, Alice!
Today is Tue Mar 25 10:30:45 EDT 2025
```

## Variables and Environment

```bash
# Setting variables
name="John"
echo $name

# Environment variables
echo $HOME
echo $PATH
export MY_VAR="custom value"  # Set environment variable
```

Example:

```bash
$ count=10
$ echo "I have $count apples"
I have 10 apples
$ export GREETING="Hello there"
$ echo $GREETING
Hello there
```

## Flow Control: If Statements and Loops

Here's a simple if statement:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# check_number.sh

echo "Enter a number:"
read num

if [ $num -gt 10 ]; then
    echo "Number is greater than 10"
elif [ $num -eq 10 ]; then
    echo "Number is equal to 10"
else
    echo "Number is less than 10"
fi
```

For loops:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# count.sh

for i in {1..5}
do
    echo "Count: $i"
done

# Loop through files
for file in *.txt
do
    echo "Found file: $file"
done
```

While loops:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# countdown.sh

counter=5
while [ $counter -gt 0 ]
do
    echo "Countdown: $counter"
    counter=$((counter-1))
    sleep 1  # Wait 1 second
done
echo "Blast off!"
```

## Command-Line Arguments

Your scripts can accept arguments:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# greet.sh

echo "Hello, $1!"  # $1 is the first argument
echo "You have $# arguments"  # $# counts the arguments
```

Usage:

```bash
$ ./greet.sh Alice
Hello, Alice!
You have 1 arguments
```

## Command Substitution and Arithmetic

```bash
current_date=$(date)  # Capture command output
echo "Today is $current_date"

# Arithmetic operations
result=$((5 + 3))
echo "5 + 3 = $result"
```

## Regular Expressions with grep

```bash
grep '^[A-Z]' file.txt  # Find lines starting with capital letters
grep -E '\b\w{7}\b' file.txt  # Find 7-letter words
```

## Common Tools Every Bash User Should Know

```bash
wc file.txt            # Count lines, words, and characters
du -sh directory/      # Get directory size
df -h                  # Check disk space
ps aux                 # List running processes
kill 1234              # Kill process with ID 1234
tar -czvf backup.tar.gz directory/  # Create compressed archive
tar -xzvf backup.tar.gz  # Extract archive
wget https://example.com/file.zip  # Download files
curl https://api.example.com  # Make HTTP requests
ssh username@hostname  # Connect to remote servers
scp file.txt username@hostname:/path/  # Copy files to remote servers
```

## Process Management

```bash
command &              # Run command in background
jobs                   # List background jobs
fg %1                  # Bring job #1 to foreground
Ctrl+Z then bg         # Suspend then continue in background
Ctrl+C                 # Terminate a running command
```

## File Permissions

```bash
ls -l                  # List files with permissions
chmod +x script.sh     # Make script executable
chmod 755 file.txt     # Set specific permissions
chown user:group file.txt  # Change file ownership
```

Permission explanation:

- First character: `-` for file, `d` for directory
- Next 3: owner permissions (r=read, w=write, x=execute)
- Next 3: group permissions
- Last 3: everyone else's permissions

Example: `-rwxr-xr--` means:

- It's a file
- Owner can read, write, execute
- Group can read and execute
- Others can only read

## Bash Visualization: Command Execution Flow

Here's a visual representation of how commands are processed in Bash:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Command Input] --> B[Parse Command]
    B --> C{Built-in Command?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Execute Built-in]
    C -->|No| E{Is it in PATH?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Find Executable]
    F --> G[Execute Program]
    E -->|No| H[Command Not Found]
    D --> I[Return Control to Shell]
    G --> I
    H --> I
```

## Scheduling Tasks with cron

```bash
crontab -e            # Edit your cron jobs
```

Cron format: `minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week command`

```
# Run backup script every day at 2:30 AM
30 2 * * * /home/user/backup.sh
```

## Creating a Sample Database Script

If you're working with databases, here's a simple SQLite example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# setup_db.sh

# Create a new SQLite database
sqlite3 testdb.sqlite <<EOF
-- Create tables
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT UNIQUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Insert some sample data
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES
  ('Alice Smith', 'alice@example.com'),
  ('Bob Jones', 'bob@example.com'),
  ('Charlie Brown', 'charlie@example.com');

-- Verify data
SELECT * FROM users;
EOF

echo "Database setup complete!"
```

Make it executable and run:

```bash
$ chmod +x setup_db.sh
$ ./setup_db.sh
```
