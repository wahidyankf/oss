Welcome to your Linux administration crash course! This guide covers the fundamental 85% of Linux administration skills you'll use daily, while giving you the foundation to explore more advanced topics independently.

## Introduction to Linux

Linux is an open-source operating system kernel created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It now powers everything from smartphones to supercomputers. Linux is organized into distributions ("distros") â€“ different flavors of the operating system with unique characteristics but sharing the same core principles.

### Key Linux Distributions

- **Ubuntu/Debian**: User-friendly, extensive package repositories, ideal for beginners
- **CentOS/Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)**: Enterprise-focused, stable, preferred in corporate environments
- **Fedora**: Cutting-edge features, sponsored by Red Hat
- **Arch Linux**: Minimalist and highly customizable
- **SUSE/OpenSUSE**: Enterprise-ready with excellent administration tools

Once you've chosen a distribution that fits your needs, the next step is setting up your Linux environment.

## Setting Up Your Linux Environment

Before diving into administration tasks, you need a Linux system to practice on. There are several ways to get started, each with its own advantages:

### Installation Methods

    A --> C[Dual Boot]
    A --> D[Cloud Instance]
    A --> E[WSL for Windows]

    B --> F[Install VirtualBox]
    F --> G[Download Linux ISO]
    G --> H[Create VM & Install]

    C --> I[Partition Disk]
    I --> J[Install from USB/DVD]

    D --> K[Create Cloud Account]
    K --> L[Launch Linux Instance]

    E --> M[Enable WSL Feature]
    M --> N[Install Linux Distro]
```

**Method 1: Virtual Machine (Recommended for Beginners)**

```bash
# Install VirtualBox on Windows/macOS
# Download an Ubuntu or CentOS ISO from their official website
# In VirtualBox:
# 1. Click "New"
# 2. Name your VM and select the Linux type and version
# 3. Allocate at least 2GB RAM
# 4. Create a virtual hard disk (20GB+)
# 5. Mount the ISO and start the VM
# 6. Follow the installation prompts
```

**Basic System Requirements:**

- 2GB RAM minimum (4GB recommended)
- 20GB disk space
- Internet connection for updates
- 64-bit processor (recommended)

With your Linux system set up, you'll need to understand how Linux organizes files and directories.

## Linux File System Hierarchy

Unlike Windows with its drive letters, Linux organizes everything in a single tree-like structure. Understanding this hierarchy is foundational for effective administration:

### Key Directories

- **/bin**: Essential command binaries (ls, cp, mv)
- **/boot**: Boot loader files and kernel
- **/dev**: Device files (hardware access)
- **/etc**: System configuration files
- **/home**: User home directories
- **/lib**: Essential shared libraries
- **/media**: Mount point for removable media
- **/mnt**: Temporary mount points
- **/opt**: Optional application software
- **/proc**: Virtual filesystem for process info
- **/root**: Home directory for the root user
- **/sbin**: System binaries (for administrators)
- **/tmp**: Temporary files (cleared on reboot)
- **/usr**: User utilities and applications
- **/var**: Variable files (logs, mail, databases)

### Navigating the File System

Now that you understand the structure, you'll need commands to navigate and manipulate files:

```bash
pwd                   # Print Working Directory - shows current location
ls -la                # List All files with details (-l=long format, -a=all files)
cd /path/to/directory # Change Directory to specified path
cd ..                 # Go up one directory level
cd ~                  # Go to your home directory
mkdir new_directory   # Create a new directory
rmdir empty_directory # Remove an empty directory
rm file.txt           # Remove a file
rm -r directory       # Remove directory and all contents (use carefully!)
```

These basic navigation commands are just the beginning. To become proficient in Linux administration, you'll need to master the command line interface.

## Command Line Fundamentals

The command line is where Linux administrators work most efficiently. While graphical interfaces exist, the real power of Linux comes through its terminal commands:

### Essential Commands

```bash
# File Operations
touch file.txt         # Create empty file
cp source destination  # Copy file (-r for directories)
mv source destination  # Move/rename file or directory
cat file.txt           # Display file contents
less file.txt          # View file contents with scrolling (q to quit)
head -n 10 file.txt    # Show first 10 lines
tail -n 10 file.txt    # Show last 10 lines
grep "pattern" file    # Search for pattern in file

# System Information
uname -a               # Kernel version and system info
cat /etc/os-release    # Distribution info
df -h                  # Disk usage (human-readable)
free -h                # Memory usage (human-readable)
top                    # Process viewer (q to quit)
ps aux                 # List all processes
```

### I/O Redirection and Pipes

What makes the Linux command line truly powerful is the ability to connect commands together, creating powerful combinations:

```bash
command > file.txt     # Redirect output to file (overwrites)
command >> file.txt    # Append output to file
command 2> errors.txt  # Redirect error messages
command1 | command2    # Pipe output from command1 to command2

# Example: Find 10 largest files in /var, sort by size
find /var -type f -exec du -h {} \; | sort -rh | head -n 10
```

With these command-line basics, you're ready to tackle one of the most important aspects of system administration: managing users and their permissions.

## User and Group Management

Linux is a multi-user system designed from the ground up for shared environments. Managing users and their access rights is a core responsibility:

### User Management Commands

```bash
# Add new user
sudo useradd -m username  # -m creates home directory

# Set/change password
sudo passwd username

# Delete user
sudo userdel -r username  # -r removes home directory

# Add user to group
sudo usermod -aG groupname username

# Create new group
sudo groupadd groupname

# View user info
id username  # Shows UID, GID and group memberships
```

### File Permissions

Linux uses a sophisticated yet elegant permission system that controls who can access files and what they can do with them:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[File Permissions] --> B[Owner]
    A --> C[Group]
    A --> D[Others]

    B --> E[Read - 4]
    B --> F[Write - 2]
    B --> G[Execute - 1]

    C --> H[Read - 4]
    C --> I[Write - 2]
    C --> J[Execute - 1]

    D --> K[Read - 4]
    D --> L[Write - 2]
    D --> M[Execute - 1]
```

```bash
# Change file permissions
chmod 755 file.txt     # Owner: rwx, Group: r-x, Others: r-x
# OR
chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx file.txt  # Same as above

# Change file owner
chown user:group file.txt
```

Numeric permissions:

- Read (r) = 4
- Write (w) = 2
- Execute (x) = 1

Common permissions:

- 755 (rwxr-xr-x): Executable files
- 644 (rw-r--r--): Regular files
- 700 (rwx------): Private scripts

With users and permissions managed, we need to look at another critical aspect of administration: controlling the programs that run on your system.

## Process Management

Every running program in Linux is a process. Managing these processes is essential for maintaining system performance and stability:

### Viewing and Managing Processes

```bash
# List processes
ps aux                # All processes (detailed)
top                   # Interactive process viewer
htop                  # Enhanced process viewer (may need installation)

# Process control
kill PID              # Send termination signal
kill -9 PID           # Force kill (last resort)
killall process_name  # Kill all processes with this name

# Background processes
command &             # Run command in background
fg                    # Bring background job to foreground
bg                    # Resume stopped job in background
jobs                  # List background jobs
nohup command &       # Run immune to hangups (stays running when you log out)
```

Understanding process management helps maintain system responsiveness. Equally important is managing the storage where your data and programs reside.

## Storage Management

Linux offers powerful tools for managing disks, partitions, and filesystems to ensure your data is organized and accessible:

### Disk and Partition Management

```bash
# List disks and partitions
lsblk                 # List block devices
fdisk -l              # List partition tables (requires sudo)

# Create and format partitions (interactive tools)
sudo fdisk /dev/sdX   # Partition a disk (X is disk letter)
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX1  # Format partition with ext4 filesystem

# Mount filesystems
sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/mountpoint
```

### Adding Permanent Mounts

To ensure your storage devices are automatically available after reboot, you need to configure them in the filesystem table:

```bash
# First create a mount point
sudo mkdir /mnt/data

# Add to /etc/fstab (use sudo):
# /dev/sdX1  /mnt/data  ext4  defaults  0  2

# Test mount
sudo mount -a  # Mount all entries in fstab
```

### Logical Volume Management (LVM)

For more advanced storage needs, Linux offers Logical Volume Management which provides flexibility in resizing and managing storage:

```bash
# Create physical volume
sudo pvcreate /dev/sdX1

# Create volume group
sudo vgcreate vg_name /dev/sdX1

# Create logical volume
sudo lvcreate -L 10G -n lv_name vg_name

# Format and mount
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg_name/lv_name
sudo mount /dev/vg_name/lv_name /mnt/mountpoint
```

With storage configured, you'll need to know how to install and manage software on your system.

## Software Management

Linux distributions use package managers to install, update, and remove software. The commands differ between distribution families:

### Debian/Ubuntu (APT)

```bash
sudo apt update             # Update package lists
sudo apt upgrade            # Upgrade installed packages
sudo apt install package    # Install package
sudo apt remove package     # Remove package
apt search keyword          # Search for package
apt show package            # Show package details
```

### RHEL/CentOS/Fedora (DNF/YUM)

```bash
sudo dnf check-update      # Update package lists
sudo dnf upgrade           # Upgrade installed packages
sudo dnf install package   # Install package
sudo dnf remove package    # Remove package
dnf search keyword         # Search for package
dnf info package           # Show package details
```

Most Linux servers connect to networks, so networking knowledge is crucial for a Linux administrator.

## Network Configuration

Networking allows your Linux system to communicate with other systems, whether locally or across the internet:

### Basic Network Commands

```bash
ip addr                    # Show IP addresses
ping hostname_or_ip        # Test connectivity
traceroute hostname_or_ip  # Trace network path
nslookup domain.com        # DNS lookup
dig domain.com             # Advanced DNS lookup
ss -tuln                   # Show listening ports
wget URL                   # Download file
curl URL                   # Get URL content
```

### Network Configuration Files

Understanding these files helps you configure networking persistently:

- **/etc/hosts**: Local hostname resolution
- **/etc/resolv.conf**: DNS settings
- **/etc/network/interfaces** (Debian/Ubuntu) or **/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/** (RHEL): Network settings

### Basic Firewall Configuration

Securing your network connections is essential:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian - UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
sudo ufw status            # Check status
sudo ufw enable            # Enable firewall
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp      # Allow SSH connections
sudo ufw allow http        # Allow HTTP (port 80)

# RHEL/CentOS - firewalld
sudo firewall-cmd --state
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=ssh --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

Once your system is networked, you need to keep an eye on its health and performance.

## System Monitoring and Logging

A responsible administrator constantly monitors system health and investigates issues through logs:

### System Monitoring

```bash
# Resource usage
top                        # CPU/memory usage (interactive)
free -h                    # Memory usage (human-readable)
df -h                      # Disk usage (human-readable)
vmstat                     # System statistics
iostat                     # Input/Output statistics
```

### Log Management

Linux keeps detailed logs that help diagnose issues:

- **/var/log/syslog** or **/var/log/messages**: General system logs
- **/var/log/auth.log** or **/var/log/secure**: Authentication logs
- **/var/log/kern.log**: Kernel logs
- **/var/log/apache2/** or **/var/log/httpd/**: Web server logs

```bash
# View logs
less /var/log/syslog      # View log file
tail -f /var/log/syslog   # Follow log updates in real-time
grep "error" /var/log/syslog  # Search logs

# Systemd journal
journalctl                # View all logs
journalctl -u service_name  # Service-specific logs
journalctl -f             # Follow new log entries
```

Proper system operation depends on services running correctly, so service management is another critical skill.

## Service Management

Modern Linux systems use systemd to manage services (daemons) that run in the background:

```bash
systemctl status service_name   # Check service status
systemctl start service_name    # Start service
systemctl stop service_name     # Stop service
systemctl restart service_name  # Restart service
systemctl enable service_name   # Enable at boot
systemctl disable service_name  # Disable at boot
systemctl list-units --type=service  # List all services
```

As your administration tasks grow more complex, you'll want to automate them through scripting.

## Basic Shell Scripting

Shell scripts allow you to automate repeated tasks, combining multiple commands into reusable tools:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# My first shell script

# Variables
NAME="Linux Admin"
echo "Hello, $NAME!"

# Command output in variable
CURRENT_DIR=$(pwd)
echo "You are in: $CURRENT_DIR"

# Conditionals
if [ "$1" = "test" ]; then
    echo "Test parameter provided"
else
    echo "No test parameter"
fi

# Loops
echo "Counting to 5:"
for i in {1..5}; do
    echo "Number: $i"
done

# Functions
my_function() {
    echo "Function executed with parameter: $1"
}

# Call function
my_function "parameter1"

# Exit with success status code
exit 0
```

Save as `myscript.sh`, then:

```bash
chmod +x myscript.sh     # Make executable
./myscript.sh test       # Run with parameter
```

### Scheduled Tasks with Cron

For tasks that need to run at specific times or intervals, Linux provides the cron system:

```bash
crontab -e               # Edit your crontab

# Format: minute hour day_of_month month day_of_week command
# Run script daily at 2:30 AM
30 2 * * * /path/to/script.sh

# Special shortcuts
@daily /path/to/script.sh
@weekly /path/to/script.sh
@monthly /path/to/script.sh
```

In our increasingly connected world, system security has become a top priority.

## Basic Security Practices

Implementing fundamental security practices helps protect your Linux systems from threats:

### System Updates

Keeping systems updated is your first line of defense:

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# RHEL/CentOS
sudo dnf upgrade -y
```

### SSH Hardening

Since SSH is often the primary way to access remote systems, securing it is crucial:

Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

```
# Disable root login
PermitRootLogin no

# Use key authentication only
PasswordAuthentication no
```

After changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

### Setting Up SSH Key Authentication

Using encryption keys instead of passwords dramatically improves security:

```bash
# On your local machine
ssh-keygen -t ed25519      # Generate key pair
ssh-copy-id user@server    # Copy to server

# Now you can login without password
ssh user@server
```
