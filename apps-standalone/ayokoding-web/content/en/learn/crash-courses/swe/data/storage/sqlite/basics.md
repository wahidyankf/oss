This crash course will equip you with the core knowledge needed for daily SQLite work. By the end, you'll understand 85% of what you'll encounter regularly, with clear pointers to the remaining 15% for self-exploration.

## Introduction to SQLite

SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, self-contained database engine that's embedded directly into applications. Unlike traditional database systems that require separate server processes, SQLite operates as an integrated part of the application itself.

**Key features:**

- Small footprint (< 15MB)
- Zero configuration required
- No separate server process needed
- Cross-platform compatibility
- ACID-compliant (ensures data integrity)
- Open-source and public domain

## Getting Started with SQLite

Before diving into database operations, you'll need to install SQLite and become familiar with its basic interface.

### Installation

SQLite likely comes pre-installed on your system. To check, open your terminal or command prompt and type:

```bash
sqlite3 --version
```

If not installed, follow these platform-specific instructions:

**Windows:**

```bash
# Download from sqlite.org/download.html
# Extract files to a directory
# Add that directory to your PATH environment variable
```

**macOS (using Homebrew):**

```bash
brew install sqlite
```

**Linux:**

```bash
# For Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install sqlite3

# For RHEL/CentOS
sudo yum install sqlite
```

### Basic Command Line Interface

Once installed, you can start SQLite from the command line by specifying a database file:

```bash
sqlite3 mydatabase.db
# This creates a new database file if it doesn't exist, or opens it if it does
```

After connecting to a database, you can use these helpful CLI commands:

```sql
.help     -- Show help text
.tables   -- List all tables
.schema   -- Show the CREATE statements for tables
.quit     -- Exit SQLite
.mode column   -- Display results in column format
.headers on    -- Show column headers in results
```

## Core Database Concepts

Now that you can access SQLite, let's explore the fundamental database operations you'll use regularly.

### Creating a Database

With SQLite, creating a database is straightforwardâ€”you simply connect to a file:

```bash
sqlite3 contacts.db
# Creates or opens the contacts.db file
```

### Creating Tables

After connecting to a database, you'll need to create tables to store your data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE contacts (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    phone TEXT,
    email TEXT
);
-- This creates a contacts table with 4 columns
-- id: Auto-incrementing primary key (unique identifier)
-- name: Required text field (cannot be NULL)
-- phone: Optional text field for phone numbers
-- email: Optional text field for email addresses
```

### Data Types in SQLite

Unlike many database systems, SQLite has a flexible approach to data types. It uses five storage classes:

1. NULL: Null values
2. INTEGER: Signed integers
3. REAL: Floating-point values
4. TEXT: Text strings
5. BLOB: Binary data

SQLite is more flexible about data types than most databases due to its "type affinity" system, which allows for automatic type conversion in many cases.

## Basic CRUD Operations

CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations form the foundation of database interactions. Let's explore each operation with practical examples.

### Creating (Inserting) Data

Once you have tables set up, you'll need to add data to them:

```sql
-- Insert a single record
INSERT INTO contacts (name, phone, email)
VALUES ('Jane Doe', '555-1234', 'jane@example.com');
-- Adds one new contact to the database

-- Insert multiple records
INSERT INTO contacts (name, phone, email) VALUES
('John Smith', '555-5678', 'john@example.com'),
('Alice Johnson', '555-9012', 'alice@example.com');
-- Adds two new contacts in one statement
```

### Reading (Querying) Data

Retrieving data is one of the most common operations you'll perform:

```sql
-- Retrieve all records and all columns
SELECT * FROM contacts;
-- Returns all data from the contacts table

-- Retrieve specific columns
SELECT name, email FROM contacts;
-- Returns only the name and email columns

-- Filter records with WHERE clause
SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE name = 'Jane Doe';
-- Returns only records where name matches exactly

-- Sort results
SELECT * FROM contacts ORDER BY name ASC;
-- Returns records sorted alphabetically by name

-- Limit results
SELECT * FROM contacts LIMIT 5;
-- Returns only the first 5 records
```

### Updating Data

As your data changes, you'll need to update existing records:

```sql
-- Update a single record
UPDATE contacts
SET phone = '555-4321'
WHERE name = 'Jane Doe';
-- Changes phone number only for Jane Doe

-- Update multiple records
UPDATE contacts
SET email = 'contact@example.com'
WHERE email IS NULL;
-- Sets a default email for contacts without one
```

### Deleting Data

Sometimes you'll need to remove data from your database:

```sql
-- Delete a specific record
DELETE FROM contacts WHERE id = 1;
-- Removes the contact with id = 1

-- Delete all records that match a condition
DELETE FROM contacts WHERE name LIKE 'John%';
-- Removes all contacts whose names start with "John"

-- Delete all records
DELETE FROM contacts;
-- Empties the contacts table (dangerous!)
```

## Working with SQLite in Python

While the SQLite command line is useful, most applications interact with SQLite through programming languages. Python includes built-in support for SQLite via the `sqlite3` module.

### Connecting to a Database

The first step in working with SQLite in Python is establishing a connection:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to a database (creates it if it doesn't exist)
conn = sqlite3.connect('my_database.db')
# Creates a connection object to interact with the database

# Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands
cursor = conn.cursor()
# Cursor is used to run queries and fetch results

# Always close the connection when done
conn.close()
# Prevents resource leaks
```

A better practice is to use Python's context manager, which automatically handles connection closure:

```python
import sqlite3

with sqlite3.connect('my_database.db') as conn:
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    # Your database operations go here
    # No need to close connection - it's handled automatically
    # Connection is committed when the block exits normally
```

### Creating a Table in Python

Creating tables in Python is similar to the SQL approach but embedded in Python code:

```python
import sqlite3

with sqlite3.connect('school.db') as conn:
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Create a table
    cursor.execute('''
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        name TEXT NOT NULL,
        age INTEGER,
        email TEXT
    )
    ''')
    # IF NOT EXISTS prevents errors if table already exists

    print("Table created successfully!")
```

### Inserting Data

Python offers convenient ways to insert data, especially when dealing with variables:

```python
import sqlite3

with sqlite3.connect('school.db') as conn:
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Insert a single record using parameterized query
    student_data = ('Jane Doe', 23, 'jane@example.com')
    cursor.execute('''
    INSERT INTO students (name, age, email)
    VALUES (?, ?, ?)
    ''', student_data)
    # ? marks are placeholders, filled by the student_data tuple
    # This prevents SQL injection attacks

    # Insert multiple records
    students = [
        ('John Smith', 21, 'john@example.com'),
        ('Alice Johnson', 22, 'alice@example.com'),
        ('Bob Brown', 20, 'bob@example.com')
    ]
    cursor.executemany('''
    INSERT INTO students (name, age, email)
    VALUES (?, ?, ?)
    ''', students)
    # executemany is more efficient for multiple inserts

    print(f"Records inserted successfully! Last row ID: {cursor.lastrowid}")
```

### Querying Data

Retrieving and working with data in Python is straightforward:

```python
import sqlite3

with sqlite3.connect('school.db') as conn:
    # Set row_factory to get named columns
    conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Query all records
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM students")
    all_students = cursor.fetchall()
    # fetchall() returns all matching rows as a list

    print("All Students:")
    for student in all_students:
        # With row_factory, we can access by column name
        print(f"ID: {student['id']}, Name: {student['name']}, Age: {student['age']}")

    # Query a single record
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM students WHERE name = ?", ('Jane Doe',))
    jane = cursor.fetchone()
    # fetchone() returns only the first matching row

    if jane:
        print(f"\nJane's Information: ID={jane['id']}, Email={jane['email']}")
    else:
        print("\nJane not found in database")
```

## Complete Database Example

Let's apply what we've learned by creating a practical project management database. This example demonstrates relationships between tables and more complex data structures.

```python
import sqlite3

# Function to set up our database
def setup_database():
    with sqlite3.connect('project_management.db') as conn:
        cursor = conn.cursor()

        # Create departments table
        cursor.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS departments (
            dept_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            dept_name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE
        )
        ''')

        # Create employees table with foreign key
        cursor.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (
            emp_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            name TEXT NOT NULL,
            title TEXT,
            dept_id INTEGER,
            FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES departments(dept_id)
        )
        ''')

        # Create tasks table
        cursor.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tasks (
            task_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            description TEXT NOT NULL,
            due_date TEXT,
            status TEXT DEFAULT 'Not Started',
            assigned_to INTEGER,
            FOREIGN KEY (assigned_to) REFERENCES employees(emp_id)
        )
        ''')

        # Insert sample data for departments
        departments = [
            (1, 'Engineering'),
            (2, 'Marketing'),
            (3, 'Human Resources')
        ]
        cursor.executemany('INSERT OR IGNORE INTO departments VALUES (?, ?)', departments)

        # Insert sample data for employees
        employees = [
            (1, 'John Doe', 'Software Engineer', 1),
            (2, 'Jane Smith', 'Marketing Specialist', 2),
            (3, 'Bob Johnson', 'HR Manager', 3),
            (4, 'Alice Williams', 'Senior Developer', 1)
        ]
        cursor.executemany('INSERT OR IGNORE INTO employees VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)', employees)

        # Insert sample data for tasks
        tasks = [
            (1, 'Develop login page', '2023-12-31', 'In Progress', 1),
            (2, 'Create marketing campaign', '2023-11-30', 'Not Started', 2),
            (3, 'Review job applications', '2023-11-15', 'Completed', 3),
            (4, 'Fix database issues', '2023-12-15', 'In Progress', 4)
        ]
        cursor.executemany('INSERT OR IGNORE INTO tasks VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)', tasks)

        print("Database setup completed successfully!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    setup_database()
```

### Database Schema Visualization

The relationships between our tables can be visualized as follows:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    DEPARTMENTS {
        int dept_id PK
        string dept_name
    }
    EMPLOYEES {
        int emp_id PK
        string name
        string title
        int dept_id FK
    }
    TASKS {
        int task_id PK
        string description
        string due_date
        string status
        int assigned_to FK
    }
    DEPARTMENTS ||--o{ EMPLOYEES : "has many"
    EMPLOYEES ||--o{ TASKS : "assigned to"
```

## Advanced Query Techniques

As your database grows, you'll need more sophisticated ways to query and analyze your data.

### Joins

Joins allow you to combine data from multiple related tables:

```sql
-- Inner join: Get employees with their department names
SELECT employees.name, employees.title, departments.dept_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.dept_id = departments.dept_id;
-- Only returns employees that have a matching department

-- Left join: Get all employees, even those without departments
SELECT employees.name, employees.title, departments.dept_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.dept_id = departments.dept_id;
-- Returns all employees, with NULL for department if no match
```

Different types of joins serve different purposes, as illustrated below:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "INNER JOIN"
        A1[Table A] --- C1[Common Records]
        B1[Table B] --- C1
    end

    subgraph "LEFT JOIN"
        A2[Table A] --- D2[All records from A]
        D2 --- E2[Matching records from B]
        B2[Table B] --- E2
    end
```

### Filtering and Aggregating Data

Beyond basic queries, SQLite provides powerful tools for filtering, grouping, and summarizing data:

```sql
-- Basic WHERE clause with multiple conditions
SELECT * FROM tasks
WHERE status = 'In Progress' AND due_date < '2024-01-01';
-- Finds tasks that are in progress and due before 2024

-- Using pattern matching
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE name LIKE 'J%';
-- Finds employees whose names start with J

-- Counting records
SELECT status, COUNT(*) AS task_count
FROM tasks
GROUP BY status;
-- Counts the number of tasks in each status category

-- Aggregate functions
SELECT
    departments.dept_name,
    COUNT(employees.emp_id) AS employee_count,
    AVG(CAST(tasks.status = 'Completed' AS INTEGER)) * 100 AS completion_percentage
FROM departments
LEFT JOIN employees ON departments.dept_id = employees.dept_id
LEFT JOIN tasks ON employees.emp_id = tasks.assigned_to
GROUP BY departments.dept_id;
-- Gets employee count and task completion percentage by department
```

## Transactions

When multiple database operations need to succeed or fail as a unit, transactions are essential. They help maintain data integrity and consistency.

```python
import sqlite3

def transfer_funds(from_account, to_account, amount):
    with sqlite3.connect('bank.db') as conn:
        try:
            # Begin transaction
            conn.execute("BEGIN TRANSACTION")

            # Check if from_account has sufficient funds
            cursor = conn.execute("SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE id = ?", (from_account,))
            from_balance = cursor.fetchone()[0]

            if from_balance < amount:
                raise Exception("Insufficient funds")

            # Deduct from from_account
            conn.execute("UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - ? WHERE id = ?",
                         (amount, from_account))

            # Add to to_account
            conn.execute("UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + ? WHERE id = ?",
                         (amount, to_account))

            # Commit the transaction
            conn.execute("COMMIT")
            print(f"Successfully transferred ${amount} from account {from_account} to {to_account}")

        except Exception as e:
            # Roll back in case of error
            conn.execute("ROLLBACK")
            print(f"Transfer failed: {e}")
```

The flow of a transaction can be visualized as follows:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Begin Transaction] --> B{Operations}
    B -->|Success| C[Commit]
    B -->|Error| D[Rollback]
    C --> E[End: Changes Saved]
    D --> F[End: No Changes Made]
```

## Performance Optimization

As your database grows, query performance becomes increasingly important. One of the most effective optimization techniques is using indexes.

### Indexes

Indexes improve query speed by creating efficient data structures for searching:

```sql
-- Create an index on a column
CREATE INDEX idx_task_status ON tasks(status);
-- Speeds up queries that filter by task status

-- Create a unique index
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_dept_name ON departments(dept_name);
-- Ensures department names are unique and speeds up lookups

-- Drop an index when no longer needed
DROP INDEX idx_task_status;
-- Removes the index to save space
```

You should consider adding indexes to:

- Columns frequently used in WHERE clauses
- Columns used in JOIN conditions
- Columns used in ORDER BY or GROUP BY

However, indexes come with tradeoffsâ€”they speed up reads but slow down writes and increase database size.

### Practical Query Optimization Example

This example demonstrates the dramatic impact indexes can have on query performance:

```python
import sqlite3
import time

def benchmark_query_with_and_without_index():
    # Create test database with large table
    with sqlite3.connect(':memory:') as conn:
        # Create table and fill with test data
        conn.execute('CREATE TABLE test (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT)')

        # Insert 100,000 records
        conn.execute('BEGIN TRANSACTION')
        for i in range(100000):
            conn.execute('INSERT INTO test VALUES (?, ?)', (i, f'Value-{i}'))
        conn.execute('COMMIT')

        # Query without index
        start_time = time.time()
        conn.execute('SELECT * FROM test WHERE value = ?', ('Value-99999',)).fetchall()
        no_index_time = time.time() - start_time

        # Create index
        conn.execute('CREATE INDEX idx_test_value ON test(value)')

        # Query with index
        start_time = time.time()
        conn.execute('SELECT * FROM test WHERE value = ?', ('Value-99999',)).fetchall()
        with_index_time = time.time() - start_time

        print(f"Query without index: {no_index_time:.6f} seconds")
        print(f"Query with index: {with_index_time:.6f} seconds")
        print(f"Speedup factor: {no_index_time/with_index_time:.2f}x")

# Run the benchmark
benchmark_query_with_and_without_index()
# Output example:
# Query without index: 0.016732 seconds
# Query with index: 0.000331 seconds
# Speedup factor: 50.55x
```
