"Primed to Perform" by Neel Doshi and Lindsay McGregor is a book that explores the science behind high-performance cultures in organizations. The authors argue that traditional methods of motivating employees, such as rewards and punishment, are ineffective in the long run. Instead, they propose a new approach to motivation, based on the science of human behavior, that focuses on meeting employees' fundamental needs.

The book draws on extensive psychology, neuroscience, and economics research to identify employees' six primary needs: total motivation, play, purpose, potential, emotional, and economic pressure. The authors explain how organizations can create a culture that meets these needs, leading to higher engagement, productivity, and innovation.

Through real-world examples and practical advice, "Primed to Perform" offers a comprehensive guide for leaders and managers who want to create a high-performance organizational culture. The book challenges traditional assumptions about motivation and provides a new framework for understanding what drives human behavior at work.
