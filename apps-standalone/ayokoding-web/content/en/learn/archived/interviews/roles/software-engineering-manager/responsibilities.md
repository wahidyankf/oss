## Key Transitions Between Levels

### Individual Contributor to Engineering Manager

This fundamental transition requires shifting from personal technical contribution to enabling others. New managers must learn to derive satisfaction from team success rather than individual accomplishments, develop people management skills, and begin thinking about systems of people rather than just systems of code.

### Engineering Manager to Senior Engineering Manager

This transition involves moving from tactical team management to more strategic thinking. Senior managers must develop the ability to work through other managers, balance resources across competing priorities, and influence without direct authority.

### Senior Engineering Manager to Director

Moving to director level requires thinking at an organizational scale. Directors create systems and processes that enable multiple teams to work effectively, develop other managers, and connect technical execution with business strategy.

### Director to VP of Engineering

The VP transition represents a shift from running engineering to helping run the company. VPs must develop executive leadership skills, understand business operations beyond engineering, and shape overall company strategy.

### VP to CTO

The CTO transition involves becoming a true technology visionary who can anticipate industry changes, position the company for long-term success, and often represent the company externally as a thought leader.
