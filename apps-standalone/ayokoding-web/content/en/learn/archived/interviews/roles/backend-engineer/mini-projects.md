According to the research, this "interview-focused approach to learning these topics" provides "better interactivity, bridging the gap between theory and practice." Each project is designed to develop the skills that interviewers specifically look for, such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and architectural decision-making.

As you work through these projects, focus not just on making them work, but on understanding the design decisions, performance tradeoffs, and security implications. This deeper understanding will allow you to explain your thought process clearly during interviews, which is often as important as the technical solution itself.

The research confirms that "by approaching these topics through the lens of interview preparation, you'll develop both the technical knowledge and the ability to communicate that knowledge effectively—a crucial skill for backend engineers who must regularly collaborate across disciplines."
