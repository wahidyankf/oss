## Core Frontend Technologies

### HTML Questions

#### 1. Explain semantic HTML and why it matters.

**Why It Matters**: Semantic HTML directly impacts accessibility, SEO, and code maintainability. Proper semantics ensure your application is usable by people with disabilities, ranks better in search engines, and remains maintainable as the codebase grows.

**Clarifying Questions**:

- Are we discussing this in the context of a particular application type?
- Should I focus on accessibility benefits or SEO benefits?

**Solution Steps**:

1. Explain the purpose of semantic markup (conveying meaning vs. just presentation)
2. Identify key semantic elements and their appropriate usage
3. Describe how semantics benefit different stakeholders (users, developers, search engines)
4. Compare semantic and non-semantic approaches to solving the same problem
5. Explain how semantics integrate with ARIA 1.3 standards for complex widgets

**Best Practices**:

- Choose the most specific and appropriate element for each content type
- Maintain logical document structure and heading hierarchy
- Combine semantic HTML with ARIA attributes when native semantics are insufficient
- Think about document outline and content relationships when structuring pages
- Implement support for advanced ARIA 1.3 roles for complex interaction patterns

**Anti-Patterns**:

- Overusing generic containers when semantic alternatives exist
- Using headings for styling rather than document structure
- Misusing semantic elements (like using `article` for non-content sections)
- Using tables for layout instead of for tabular data
- Adding excessive ARIA attributes to elements that already have semantic meaning

#### 2. How would you optimize a website for accessibility?

**Why It Matters**: Accessibility ensures applications are usable by people with disabilities (15-20% of the population), often has legal implications, and generally improves usability for all users.

**Solution Steps**:

1. Base implementation on semantic HTML for proper structure and meaning
2. Implement keyboard navigation and focus management for all interactive elements
3. Add appropriate ARIA attributes where native semantics are insufficient
4. Ensure sufficient color contrast and text alternatives for non-text content
5. Test with assistive technologies and implement fixes based on findings
6. Create inclusive design patterns that work across input methods and abilities
7. Implement advanced ARIA 1.3 patterns for complex widgets and interactions

**Best Practices**:

- Build accessibility in from the beginning rather than retrofitting
- Follow WCAG 2.2 guidelines (aim for AA compliance at minimum)
- Create reusable, accessible component patterns
- Test with actual assistive technologies and real users with disabilities
- Integrate accessibility testing into CI/CD pipelines

**Anti-Patterns**:

- Relying solely on automated testing tools for accessibility validation
- Disabling focus styles without alternatives
- Creating custom controls when accessible HTML elements would suffice
- Using color alone to convey important information
- Treating accessibility as a separate feature rather than a fundamental requirement

### CSS Questions

#### 3. Explain the CSS box model and how it affects layout.

**Why It Matters**: The box model is fundamental to creating predictable layouts. Misunderstanding it leads to unexpected rendering and difficult debugging sessions that consume development time.

**Solution Steps**:

1. Define the box model components and their relationship (content, padding, border, margin)
2. Explain the difference between standard and alternative box-sizing models
3. Describe how width/height calculations differ between box-sizing models
4. Explain margin collapsing behavior and when it occurs
5. Demonstrate how the box model influences responsive layouts

**Best Practices**:

- Use `box-sizing: border-box` for more intuitive sizing behavior
- Be aware of margin collapsing in vertical layouts
- Use consistent box-sizing throughout your application
- Consider how percentage-based sizing works in relation to parent elements
- Use logical properties (margin-block, padding-inline) for internationalization support

**Anti-Patterns**:

- Mixing box-sizing models without clear purpose
- Using fixed heights that don't accommodate dynamic content
- Using nested elements to solve padding/margin issues
- Creating complex margin calculations that become difficult to maintain
- Overriding box model properties instead of understanding root causes

#### 4. Describe your approach to implementing a responsive design.

**Why It Matters**: Responsive design ensures applications work across devices, directly impacting user experience, engagement metrics, and business outcomes. With mobile traffic often exceeding 50% of total traffic, this is business-critical.

**Clarifying Questions**:

- Is this for a new project or adapting an existing one?
- Are we prioritizing mobile-first or desktop-first?
- Do we have specific breakpoints or do we need to establish them?

**Solution Steps**:

1. Choose a mobile-first or desktop-first approach based on user demographics and business needs
2. Establish breakpoints based on content needs rather than specific devices
3. Implement fluid layouts and flexible elements using relative units
4. Use appropriate media queries to adjust layouts at breakpoints
5. Consider performance implications across different devices
6. Test across multiple device sizes and input types
7. Implement container queries for component-specific responsive behavior
8. Use feature queries for progressive enhancement

**Best Practices**:

- Design for content flexibility rather than specific screen sizes
- Use modern layout techniques (Flexbox/Grid) for responsive behavior
- Test on actual devices, not just browser simulations
- Consider both touch and mouse interactions
- Use appropriately sized images for different screen resolutions
- Implement container queries for more modular responsive components

**Anti-Patterns**:

- Creating separate mobile and desktop sites
- Using fixed pixel widths that don't adapt
- Hiding important content on mobile instead of adapting it
- Implementing complex layout overrides at each breakpoint
- Relying on device-specific media queries
- Creating overly complex media query hierarchies

4. Discuss memory implications and potential issues
5. Explain how closures interact with modern JavaScript features (modules, classes)

**Best Practices**:

- Use closures intentionally for encapsulation and state management
- Be aware of memory retention patterns when creating closures
- Return only necessary functions/data from closure functions
- Document closure behavior in complex implementations
- Consider performance implications in hot code paths

**Anti-Patterns**:

- Creating closures unintentionally, causing memory leaks
- Overusing closures for simple cases where they add complexity
- Capturing large objects in closures that persist longer than needed
- Creating deeply nested closures that become difficult to reason about
- Using closures when more modern patterns would be clearer

5. Implement targeted optimizations and verify improvements with measurements
6. Consider advanced optimization approaches:
   - WebAssembly for computationally intensive tasks
   - Web Workers for parallelization
   - Off-main thread animation techniques

**Best Practices**:

- Measure before and after optimization to verify improvements
- Focus on user-perceptible performance issues first
- Look for patterns rather than micro-optimizations
- Test on representative devices, especially for mobile performance
- Use performance budgets to prevent regressions
- Implement monitoring for long-term performance tracking
