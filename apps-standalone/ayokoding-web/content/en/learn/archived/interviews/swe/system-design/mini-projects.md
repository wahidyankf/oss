## Recommended Approach for Each Project

For each mini-project, follow the "UNDER" method to structure your approach:

1. **Understanding the business domain**: Clarify the problem space and requirements before starting implementation
2. **Narrowing the scope**: Define clear boundaries for what your implementation will and won't include
3. **Discovering numbers**: Establish performance requirements and constraints for the system
4. **Evaluating basic design**: Create an initial architecture and validate it against requirements
5. **Redesigning current architecture**: Iteratively improve your implementation based on testing and feedback

## Implementation Strategy

For optimal learning with each mini-project:

1. **Start Small**: Begin with a minimal viable implementation focusing on the core concepts
2. **Iterate**: Add complexity gradually as you master the basics
3. **Document**: Keep notes on design decisions, challenges, and solutions
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Deliberately create failure scenarios to test resilience
5. **Measure**: Collect metrics to understand performance characteristics
6. **Visualize**: Create diagrams that explain your architecture and implementation choices
