This comprehensive guide presents carefully curated mini-projects designed to help software engineers master algorithms and data structures for technical interviews. Following research-backed interview-focused learning principles, these projects build both technical proficiency and the critical thinking skills employers value.

Each project targets specific interview concepts with practical applications, organized in a progressive learning path from fundamental to advanced topics.

## Why Interview-Focused Learning Works for Software Engineers

1. Stimulates critical thinking and problem-solving skills applicable to daily work
2. Enhances communication abilities and builds professional confidence
3. Bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and job requirements
4. Helps digest complex information through real-world scenarios
5. Provides safe practice environments before facing actual interviews
