## What is Iterative and Incremental Development?

Imagine if you're making a vast Lego castle. It's so big; you can't build it all at once. So, what do you do? You build it step-by-step, part by part. Iterative and Incremental Development is just like that.

- **Iterative** means you build a small part, then improve it repeatedly, like adding more to your Lego castle daily.
- **Incremental** means it's something meaningful each time you add a new part. For today, you build a tower; tomorrow, you add a gate; and the next day, a garden.

So, with iterative and incremental development, every little piece we build makes our software better and better. We keep adding and improving until we have our big, finished software castle!

## Benefits and Downsides of Iterative and Incremental Development

### Benefits

- **Get to play earlier**: You can start playing before the castle is built. Each new piece you build can be used right away.
- **Learn as you go**: If you make a mistake or find a better way to build your castle, you can change it the next time you add a piece.
- **Less scary**: It's less overwhelming to think about one piece at a time rather than the entire castle simultaneously.

### Downsides

- **Hard to plan**: It can be hard to know precisely how long it will take to build the entire castle because you're figuring it out as you go.
- If you learn something new that changes your plan, you might need to redo some parts of the castle you built.
- It c**an be repetitive**: You may need to do some things repeatedly, like checking that the castle is still sturdy each time you add a new piece.
