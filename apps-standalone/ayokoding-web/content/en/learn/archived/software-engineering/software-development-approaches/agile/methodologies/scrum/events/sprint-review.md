The sprint review is an actual ceremony in the Scrum framework, which focuses on inspecting the product increment at the end of each sprint. This review allows the Scrum team and stakeholders to evaluate the work completed during the sprint and gather feedback for future iterations. This guide will explore various aspects of the sprint review, including its goals, attendees, duration, preparation, and best practices.

## Goals

The sprint review serves as an opportunity to evaluate the progress made during the sprint and ensure everyone is on the same page regarding the product's direction. To achieve this, the review has several key goals:

1. **Inspect the Product Increment**: During the sprint review, the Scrum team showcases the product increment developed during the sprint. This includes presenting the completed user stories and demonstrating the functionality added to the product.
2. **Obtain Feedback**: One of the sprint review's most important aspects is gathering feedback from stakeholders and attendees. This feedback can help identify areas for improvement or changes that need to be made to the product.
3. **Collaborate and Align**: The sprint review is also an opportunity for collaboration between the Scrum team and stakeholders. By working together, the team can ensure everyone is aligned on the product's direction and priorities.
4. **Adapt the Product Backlog**: Based on the feedback received during the sprint review, the Scrum team and product owner work together to update the product backlog. This ensures that the product continues to evolve in response to user needs and requirements.
5. **Celebrate Achievements**: The sprint review is an opportunity to celebrate the team's achievements. By taking the time to recognize the hard work and progress made during the sprint, the team can feel motivated and inspired to continue working towards the project's goals.

## Non-goals

While the sprint review focuses on inspecting the product increment and gathering feedback, it is essential to note its non-goals. However, the sprint review is more comprehensive than the activities discussed below. Instead, it is a platform for various activities that could help improve the product and the team's performance. Here are some additional activities that are not typically part of the sprint review but could be incorporated:

- **Brainstorming Sessions**: Though the sprint review is not the forum for deep problem-solving discussions, it could be an avenue for brainstorming sessions where team members could suggest solutions to identified issues.
- **Team Building Exercises**: While the review does not provide a detailed status update on each task, it could still be used as an opportunity for team-building exercises. This could foster camaraderie and improve the team's cohesion.
- **Training Sessions**: The sprint review could also be an avenue for training sessions where team members could learn new skills to help in future sprints. This could be beneficial for both the team and the product.

## Output

The sprint review is an important event in the Scrum framework. During the review, the Scrum team and product owner discuss the product increment's current state. The primary output of the sprint review is a shared understanding of the product increment, which is necessary for the development team to move forward with the next sprint.

However, the sprint review is about more than just understanding the current state of the product increment. It is also an opportunity for the team to receive feedback from stakeholders and customers. This feedback is essential as it helps the team and product owner make informed decisions about the product backlog and upcoming sprints.

The feedback received during the review may result in new user stories, updated priorities, or changes to the overall product vision. This is because the sprint review provides a valuable opportunity for the team to reflect on their work and make adjustments as necessary.

## Participants

A sprint review is a collaborative event that involves various participants. The key attendees typically include:

1. **Scrum Team** includes the product owner, Scrum Master, and development team members who worked on the sprint. The product owner is responsible for ensuring the team builds the right product. At the same time, the Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring that the team follows the Scrum framework. The development team members are also responsible for building the product and delivering it to the customer.
2. **Stakeholders**: Individuals who have a vested interest in the product, such as customers, users, executives, or other relevant parties. These stakeholders may have different interests, such as ensuring that the product meets their needs or aligns with their business goals. It is essential to ensure their needs are met during the sprint review.

During the sprint review, the attendees come together to review the work completed during the sprint. This includes reviewing the product backlog, sprint backlog, and any work completed during the sprint. The attendees also discussed any challenges during the sprint and how they were resolved. This is an opportunity for the team to receive feedback from the stakeholders and ensure that the product meets their needs.

## Who Leads It?

The sprint review is an integral part of the Scrum framework used to inspect and adapt the product increment at the end of each sprint. In this meeting, the product owner leads the discussion and provides context about the product increment. At the same time, the Scrum Master facilitates the event and ensures that everyone can provide feedback.

The product owner is responsible for ensuring that the session remains focused on the sprint's goals and that the team can identify areas for improvement. They work closely with the development team to ensure that the product increment meets the needs of the stakeholders.

Similarly, the Scrum Master is crucial in ensuring the event runs smoothly. They are responsible for facilitating the discussion and ensuring that everyone can participate. They work closely with the product owner and the development team to identify areas for improvement and ensure that the team can deliver high-quality products.

## Duration

The duration of the sprint review depends on several factors, including the sprint's length, the product's complexity, and the number of stakeholders involved. It is essential to balance providing enough time for a comprehensive review and avoiding information overload.

As a general guideline, sprint reviews for shorter sprints, such as one or two weeks, typically last around one hour. During this time, the team can present their progress, discuss any issues that arise, and receive feedback from stakeholders.

The review may take two to three hours for longer sprints, such as three or four weeks. This lengthier session allows for a more detailed examination of the product increment, including any challenges encountered and how they were overcome.

It is crucial to keep the session concise, focusing on the most critical aspects to maximize engagement and effectiveness. However, allowing ample time for discussion and feedback is also essential, as this can often lead to valuable insights and improvements for future sprints.

## Preparation

The Scrum team must make several preparations to ensure a successful sprint review. Below are some ideas on how to make the most out of the review process:

1. **Product Increment**: The Scrum team should take a step back and evaluate the product increment they have been working on. Are there any features that could be added to make it more valuable to the users? Are there any bugs that need fixing? If there are, the team should prioritize working on them before the sprint review so that the product increment is as polished as possible.
2. **Invite Stakeholders**: While inviting stakeholders to the sprint review is essential, it is equally important to ensure that the right stakeholders are invited. The product owner should coordinate with stakeholders to ensure that the right people attend the review meeting and that representation is from different perspectives. This will ensure that the feedback received during the review is diverse and valuable.
3. **Demo and Presentation**: The team should create a demo showcasing the product increment's functionality and highlighting the completed user stories. However, the demo should also be engaging and interactive. This will give the stakeholders a chance to ask questions and provide feedback. Additionally, the team should create a concise presentation that provides context and outlines the sprint's achievements. This will help the stakeholders understand the product increment's value and the team's progress throughout the sprint.

## Procession

The sprint review process is a crucial part of the Scrum framework that serves as a platform for the Scrum team and stakeholders to come together and assess the project's progress. The review follows a structured procession that aims to achieve the following:

1. **Introduction**: The product owner welcomes the attendees, sets the context for the sprint, and reiterates the goals of the product.
2. **Product Increment Demo**: The team presents the product increment to the stakeholders, showcasing the completed user stories and any relevant features. The interactive demo should allow stakeholders to explore the product's functionality thoroughly.
3. **Q&A and Feedback**: The stakeholders ask questions, provide feedback, and share their observations about the product increment. The Scrum team listens attentively, capturing valuable insights and potential changes that could be made to the product.
4. **Collaborative Discussion**: The team and stakeholders discuss to align their understanding of the product increment, clarify requirements, and address any concerns.
5. **Updating the Product Backlog**: Based on the feedback received, the product owner and Scrum team collaborate to update the product backlog. New user stories are added, priorities may change, and adjustments are made to the overall product roadmap to ensure that the team is on track to deliver a successful product.

## Do's

To ensure a productive sprint review, consider the following best practices:

- **Prepare an Engaging Demo**: Create a demo that showcases the completed user stories and provides a clear understanding of the product increment's functionality. Make sure to tailor the demo to the audience, highlighting the most relevant features. You can also include demos of related features that must be implemented to give stakeholders a sense of the product's future direction.
- **Encourage Active Participation**: Invite stakeholders to engage during the review actively, asking questions, providing feedback, and sharing their insights. You can also encourage them to bring their ideas to the table and discuss potential solutions to any issues.
- **Focus on Feedback**: Listen attentively to the feedback received and take notes. Ensure that all relevant observations and suggestions are captured for further consideration. After the review, you can also follow up with stakeholders to address any outstanding issues and get additional feedback.
- **Maintain a Positive Environment**: Foster a collaborative, respectful atmosphere that encourages open communication and constructive criticism. You can also provide refreshments and snacks to create a more relaxed and welcoming environment.
- **Drive Actionable Next Steps**: Discuss and decide on actionable next steps based on the feedback received, updating the product backlog accordingly. You can also assign tasks to team members and set deadlines to ensure progress on the product increment.

## Don'ts

To avoid potential pitfalls during the sprint review, keep the following points in mind:

- **Avoid Detailed Problem Solving**: While addressing any issues during the sprint review is essential, there is a better time to go into too much detail or try to solve complex problems. Instead, please note any issues that require further investigation outside of the review so that they can be adequately addressed later.
- **Don't Overshare Technical Details**: While it's important to highlight the technical achievements during the sprint, it's equally important to ensure that stakeholders can understand the functionality and outcomes of the project. Instead of focusing solely on the technical aspects, provide context and examples that demonstrate the work's value and impact.
- **Avoid Defensiveness**: When receiving feedback, embracing it as an opportunity for improvement rather than becoming defensive or dismissing suggestions is essential. Take time to fully consider any feedback given and use it to make any necessary adjustments to the project.
- **Don't Overrun the Timebox**: To ensure that the sprint review stays within the allocated timebox, it's essential to keep the sessions concise and compelling. Stick to the agenda and avoid going off-topic or bogged down in unnecessary details. If necessary, use visual aids or other methods to help keep the discussion focused and on track.
