## **The Agile Manifesto**

Established in 2001 by a consortium of software development luminaries, the Agile Manifesto is the bedrock of Agile software development. The manifesto proclaims:

> "We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work, we have come to value:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.

While recognizing the merit in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more."

## The Twelve Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto

> Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
>
> 1. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
> 2. Deliver working software frequently, with a preference for the shorter timescale.
> 3. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
> 4. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.
> 5. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
> 6. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
> 7. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
> 8. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
> 9. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
> 10. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
> 11. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## Why is it important?

Before delving into the details of agile software development, such as Scrum, it is important to understand the Agile Manifesto and its twelve principles. Here's why these things are important::

1. **Guiding Framework**: The Agile Manifesto provides a framework for approaching software development projects, offering a set of values and principles that shape the mindset, culture, and practices within agile teams.
2. **Customer-Centric Focus**: The Agile Manifesto emphasizes satisfying the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. By aligning with these principles, organizations can prioritize customer collaboration, adapt to changing requirements, and deliver effective software that meets customer needs.
3. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Agile principles recognize the need for flexibility and adaptability in software development. By welcoming change, responding to it, and delivering software frequently, agile teams can remain responsive to evolving customer requirements and market dynamics.
4. **Effective Collaboration**: The Agile Manifesto promotes individuals and interactions over processes and tools. This emphasis on collaboration and communication fosters effective teamwork, knowledge sharing, and decision-making within development teams.
5. **Continuous Improvement**: The twelve principles behind the Agile Manifesto emphasize reflection, self-improvement, and continuous learning. Agile teams regularly evaluate their practices and behaviors to identify areas for improvement and refine their processes over time.
6. **Efficient Software Delivery**: By prioritizing working software over comprehensive documentation, agile methodologies enable teams to focus on delivering functional software increments quickly. This approach helps mitigate risks, receive early feedback, and ensure that delivered software meets customer expectations.
7. **Maximizing Customer Value**: Agile values and principles help teams maximize customer value by encouraging close collaboration, delivering high-quality software, and actively involving customers throughout development. This customer-centric approach improves customer satisfaction and increases the likelihood of delivering software that addresses their needs.
8. **Sustainable Development**: Agile processes promote sustainable development, where sponsors, developers, and users can maintain a constant pace indefinitely. This principle recognizes the importance of establishing a sustainable work rhythm that supports long-term productivity and avoids burnout.

Understanding the Agile Manifesto and its twelve principles provides a foundation for adopting agile practices, fostering effective collaboration, delivering value to customers, promoting sustainability, and continuously improving the software development process. It enables organizations and individuals to embrace agility, adapt to change, and drive innovation in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.
