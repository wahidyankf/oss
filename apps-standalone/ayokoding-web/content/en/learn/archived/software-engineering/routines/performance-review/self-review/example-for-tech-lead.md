## **Review of Goals**

At the beginning of the performance period, I set the following goals for myself:

### **Goal 1: Lead the development of a new product from ideation to launch**

To achieve this goal, I worked closely with our product team to identify a new product opportunity and developed a plan for the development process. I led the team through the ideation, design, development, and launch phases, ensuring that the product met our quality standards and was delivered on time.

**Result**: Successfully launched a new product that generated $500,000 in revenue in the first quarter.

### **Goal 2: Improve the performance of our backend systems by implementing a microservices architecture**

To achieve this goal, I worked with our team to identify areas where we could improve the performance of our backend systems. I researched and proposed a microservices architecture that would allow us to scale our systems more efficiently. I then led the team through the implementation process, ensuring the architecture was optimized for performance and maintainability.

**Result**: Improved the performance of our backend systems by 50% and reduced the number of system failures by 75%.

### **Goal 3: Mentor two junior developers and help them improve their technical skills**

To achieve this goal, I identified two junior developers on our team who needed guidance and support. I worked with them to identify areas where they needed improvement and provided guidance and feedback. I also provided opportunities for them to work on challenging projects and gain experience in new technologies.

**Result**: Both junior developers successfully completed challenging projects and received positive feedback from their peers and stakeholders. One of them was promoted to a senior developer role.

## **Accomplishments**

In addition to achieving my goals, I contributed significantly to our team's success. Here are some of my key accomplishments using the STAR method:

### **Product Development**

**Situation**: Our team identified a new product opportunity that required development from ideation to launch.

**Task**: Led the development of the new product and ensured that it met our quality standards and was delivered on time.

**Action**: Worked closely with our product team to develop a plan for the development process. I led the team through the ideation, design, development, and launch phases, ensuring that the product met our quality standards and was delivered on time.

**Result**: Successfully launched a new product that generated $500,000 in revenue in the first quarter.

### **Architecture**

**Situation**: Our backend systems were experiencing performance issues and system failures.

**Task**: Improve the performance of our backend systems by implementing a microservices architecture.

**Action**: Researched and proposed a microservices architecture allowing us to scale our systems more efficiently. Led the team through the implementation process, ensuring the architecture was optimized for performance and maintainability.

**Result**: Improved the performance of our backend systems by 50% and reduced the number of system failures by 75%.

### **Mentoring**

Situation: Two junior developers on our team needed guidance and support to improve their technical skills.

**Task**: Mentor the junior developers and provide opportunities for them to work on challenging projects and gain experience in new technologies.

**Action**: Worked with the junior developers to identify improvement areas and provided guidance and feedback. They provided opportunities to work on challenging projects and gain experience in new technologies.

**Result**: Both junior developers completed challenging projects and received positive feedback from their peers and stakeholders. One of them was promoted to a senior developer role.

### **Process Improvement**

**Situation**: Our team was experiencing many bugs in our code.

Task: Improve code quality and reduce bugs by implementing a new code review process.

**Action**: Identified areas where our code quality could be improved and proposed a new code review process. Worked with the team to implement the new strategy and provided training and guidance on best practices for code review.

**Result**: Improved code quality by 30% and reduced the number of bugs in our code by 40%.

## **Areas for Improvement**

While I am proud of my accomplishments, I recognize that there are areas where I can improve. Specifically, I need to work on delegating tasks more effectively and providing more opportunities for my team members to take on leadership roles.

To address this, I plan to work with my team to identify areas where they can take on more responsibility and provide them with the support and guidance they need to succeed.

## Goals and Aspirations

I want to continue leading and mentoring my team in the next performance period. Specifically, I would like to:

### Goal 1: Improve our testing process and reduce the number of bugs in our code

I believe improving our testing process is vital to reducing the bugs in our code. To achieve this goal, I plan to work with our QA team to identify areas where we can improve our testing process and implement new tools and techniques to improve our testing coverage.

**Target**: Reduce the number of bugs in our code by 50%.

### Goal 2: Develop a training program for new hires and junior developers

Providing new hires and junior developers with a structured training program is vital to their success. To achieve this goal, I plan to work with our HR team to develop a training program that covers key technologies and best practices for software development.

**Target**: Increase the retention rate of new hires and junior developers by 20%.

### Goal 3: Improve our project management process and ensure that projects are delivered on time and within budget

I believe that effective project management is vital to our team's success. To achieve this goal, I plan to work with our project managers to identify areas where we can improve our project management process and implement new tools and techniques to ensure that projects are delivered on time and within budget.

**Target**: Increase the on-time delivery rate of projects by 25%.

## Conclusion

I am proud of my accomplishments during this performance period and excited to continue leading and mentoring my team. I am committed to achieving my goals and contributing to the success of our projects. Thank you for the opportunity to provide this self-review.
