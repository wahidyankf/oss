## **Review of Goals**

At the beginning of the performance period, I set the following goals for myself:

### **Goal 1: Lead the development of a new feature for our flagship product**

To achieve this goal, I worked closely with our product team to identify a new feature opportunity and developed a plan for the development process. I led the team through the design, development, and launch phases, ensuring that the feature met our quality standards and was delivered on time.

**Result**: Successfully launched a new feature that increased user engagement by 20%.

### **Goal 2: Improve the performance of our web application by optimizing database queries**

To achieve this goal, I worked with our team to identify areas where we could improve the performance of our web application. I analyzed our database queries and proposed optimizations that would reduce the response time of our application. I then led the team through the implementation process, ensuring the optimizations were practical and not introducing new issues.

**Result**: Reduced the response time of our web application by 30%.

### **Goal 3: Mentor two junior developers and help them improve their technical skills**

To achieve this goal, I identified two junior developers on our team who needed guidance and support. I worked with them to identify areas where they needed improvement and provided guidance and feedback. I also provided opportunities for them to work on challenging projects and gain experience in new technologies.

**Result**: Both junior developers successfully completed challenging projects and received positive feedback from their peers and stakeholders. One of them was promoted to a mid-level engineer role.

## **Accomplishments**

In addition to achieving my goals, I contributed significantly to our team's success. Here are some of my key accomplishments using the STAR method:

### **Feature Development**

**Situation**: Our team identified a new feature opportunity that required development from design to launch.

**Task**: Led the development of the new feature and ensured that it met our quality standards and was delivered on time.

**Action**: Worked closely with our product team to develop a plan for the development process. Led the team through the design, development, and launch phases, ensuring that the feature met our quality standards and was delivered on time.

**Result**: Successfully launched a new feature that increased user engagement by 20%.

### **Performance Optimization**

**Situation**: Our web application was experiencing slow response times.

**Task**: Improve the performance of our web application by optimizing database queries.

**Action**: Analyzed our database queries and proposed optimizations that would reduce the response time of our application. Led the team through the implementation process, ensuring the optimizations were effective and did not introduce new issues.

**Result**: Reduced the response time of our web application by 30%.

### **Mentoring**

**Situation**: Two junior developers on our team needed guidance and support to improve their technical skills.

**Task**: Mentor the junior developers and provide opportunities for them to work on challenging projects and gain experience in new technologies.

**Action**: Worked with the junior developers to identify improvement areas and provided guidance and feedback. They provided opportunities to work on challenging projects and gain experience in new technologies.

**Result**: Both junior developers successfully completed challenging projects and received positive feedback from their peers and stakeholders. One of them was promoted to a mid-level engineer role.

### **Areas for Improvement**

While I am proud of my accomplishments, I recognize that there are areas where I can improve. Specifically, I need to improve my communication skills and provide more constructive feedback to my team members.

To address this, I plan to work on actively listening to my team members and providing specific feedback that is actionable and supportive.

## **Goals and Aspirations**

I want to continue leading and mentoring my team in the next performance period. Specifically, I would like to:

### **Goal 1: Improve the scalability of our web application by implementing a distributed caching system**

I believe that implementing a distributed caching system is vital to improving the scalability of our web application. To achieve this goal, I plan to work with our team to identify areas where we can implement caching and design a scalable, fault-tolerant system.

**Target**: Increase the number of concurrent users our web application can handle by 50%.

### **Goal 2: Develop a training program for mid-level engineers to help them advance to senior roles**

Providing mid-level engineers with a structured training program is vital to their success and growth within the company. To achieve this goal, I plan to work with our HR team to develop a training program that covers critical skills and best practices for advancing to a senior engineer role.

**Target**: Increase the number of mid-level engineers who advance to senior roles by 25%.

### Goal 3: Improve our code review process and ensure that code quality is maintained

Effective code review is vital to maintaining code quality and maintaining our codebase. To achieve this goal, I plan to work with our team to identify areas where we can improve our code review process and implement new tools and techniques to maintain code quality.

**Target**: Improve code quality by 20% and reduce the number of bugs in our code by 30%.

## Conclusion

I am proud of my accomplishments during this performance period and excited to continue leading and mentoring my team. I am committed to achieving my goals and contributing to the success of our projects. Thank you for the opportunity to provide this self-review.
