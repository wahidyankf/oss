## **Review of Goals**

At the beginning of the performance period, my goals were to become proficient in Python and contribute to developing two significant projects. I am happy to report that I have met both of these goals. I have become comfortable with Python and contributed to developing both projects.

## **Accomplishments**

### **Project A**

**Situation:** Our client requested a new Project A feature to increase user engagement.

**Task:** I was tasked with developing a new feature using Python and Django.

**Action:** I worked closely with clients to understand their requirements and developed a feature prototype. I then collaborated with my team members to integrate the feature into the existing codebase and conducted extensive testing to ensure it worked properly.

**Result:** The new feature increased user engagement on the platform by 25%, as measured by the number of daily active users.

### **Project B**

**Situation:** Project B had several bugs that were affecting the user experience.

**Task:** I was tasked with fixing the bugs and improving the user interface.

**Action:** I conducted a thorough analysis of the codebase to identify the source of the bugs. I then worked with my team members to develop and implement solutions. I also conducted user testing to gather feedback on the user interface and made improvements based on the feedback.

**Result:** The bugs were fixed, and the user interface was improved, resulting in a 15% increase in user satisfaction, as measured by user surveys.

## **Areas for Improvement**

One area for improvement is my communication skills. I have sometimes struggled to communicate my ideas to my team members. I plan to attend a communication skills workshop and practice presenting to address this.

## **Goals and Aspirations**

Looking ahead, I have several goals and aspirations that I would like to achieve in my role as a software engineer:

**Develop my technical skills:** I plan to continue developing my technical skills, particularly in data analysis and machine learning. I will achieve this by taking online courses, attending workshops, and working on personal projects.

**Become a mentor:** I aspire to mentor junior software engineers. I believe I can provide valuable guidance and support to new hires and help them develop their skills and achieve their goals.

**Contribute to the development of new hires:** I would like to contribute to the development of new hires by participating in the hiring process and providing feedback on candidates. I can help identify talented individuals who will fit our team well.

**Improve my leadership skills:** As I progress in my career, I want to develop my leadership skills. I can become an effective leader by setting a positive example, communicating clearly, and supporting and guiding my team members. I plan to attend leadership workshops and seek opportunities for leadership roles within my team.

**Contribute to the company's success:** I am committed to contributing to the success of the company. I plan to do this by staying current with industry trends and best practices and identifying opportunities for innovation and improvement within our projects.

**Develop my soft skills:** Besides technical skills, I believe that soft skills are also crucial for success in my role. I plan to develop my communication, collaboration, and problem-solving skills by participating in team-building activities and seeking feedback from my colleagues.

## **Conclusion**

I am proud of my accomplishments as a junior software engineer over the past year. I have met my goals and contributed to my team's success. I am committed to learning and growing in my role and achieving my goals and aspirations. I believe that by doing so, I can make a valuable contribution to the company and the software engineering community.
