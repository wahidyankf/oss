## **Review of Goals**

At the beginning of the performance period, I set the following goals for myself:

### **Goal 1: Improve the performance and scalability of our platform by implementing a microservices architecture**

**Result**: Improved the performance and scalability of our platform by 75% and reduced the number of system failures by 90%.

### **Goal 2: Improve developer productivity by implementing new tools and processes**

**Result**: Increased developer productivity by 50% and reduced the time it takes to deliver new features by 40%.

### **Goal 3: Improve infrastructure monitoring and management**

**Result**: Reduced the time it takes to identify and resolve system issues by 50%.

### **Goal 4: Mentor junior engineers and help them improve their technical skills**

**Result**: Successfully mentored two junior engineers who completed challenging projects and received positive feedback from their peers and stakeholders. One of them was promoted to a senior engineer role.

## **Accomplishments**

In addition to achieving my goals, I contributed significantly to our team's success. Here are some of my key accomplishments:

### **Architecture**

**Situation**: Our platform was experiencing performance issues and system failures due to its monolithic architecture.

**Task**: I researched and proposed a microservices architecture that would allow us to scale our systems more efficiently.

**Action**: I led the team through the implementation process, ensuring the architecture was optimized for performance and maintainability.

**Result**: Improved the performance and scalability of our platform by 75% and reduced the number of system failures by 90%.

### **Developer Productivity**

**Situation**: Our development process was slow and inefficient, delaying the delivery of new features.

**Task**: I worked with our development team to identify areas where we could improve our development process and increase productivity.

**Action**: I researched and proposed new tools and processes that would streamline our development workflow and reduce the time it takes to deliver new features.

**Result**: Increased developer productivity by 50% and reduced the time it takes to deliver new features by 40%.

### **Infrastructure**

**Situation**: Our infrastructure was challenging to monitor and manage, leading to delays in identifying and resolving system issues.

**Task**: I identified the need for new monitoring and alerting tools to improve our infrastructure.

**Action**: I researched and proposed new tools that would allow us to monitor our systems more effectively and receive alerts in real time.

**Result**: Reduced the time it takes to identify and resolve system issues by 50%.

### **Mentoring**

**Situation**: We had junior engineers on our team who needed guidance and support.

**Task**: I identified two junior engineers who needed improvement and provided guidance and feedback.

**Action**: I provided opportunities for them to work on challenging projects and gain experience in new technologies.

**Result**: Both junior engineers successfully completed challenging projects and received positive feedback from their peers and stakeholders. One of them was promoted to a senior engineer role.

## **Areas for Improvement**

While I am proud of my accomplishments, I recognize that there are areas where I can improve. Specifically, I need to work on delegating tasks more effectively and providing more opportunities for my team members to take on leadership roles.

To address this, I plan to work with my team to identify areas where they can take on more responsibility and provide them with the support and guidance they need to succeed.

## **Goals and Aspirations**

In the next performance period, I would like to continue to improve our platform, infrastructure, and developer productivity. Specifically, I would like to:

### **Goal 1: Improve our testing process and reduce the number of bugs in our code**

**Target**: Reduce the number of bugs in our code by 75%.

### **Goal 2: Develop a training program for engineers to improve their technical skills**

**Target**: Increase the technical skills of our engineers by 30%.

### Goal 3: Improve our infrastructure by implementing new automation tools

**Target**: Reduce the time required to deploy new features by 50%.

### Goal 4: Increase team collaboration and communication

**Target**: Improve team collaboration and communication by implementing new processes and tools.

## Conclusion

Overall, I am proud of my accomplishments during this performance period and am excited to continue to improve our platform, infrastructure, and developer productivity. I am committed to achieving my goals and contributing to the success of our projects. Thank you for the opportunity to provide this self-review.
