The `LEFT JOIN` or `LEFT OUTER JOIN` in SQL is a concept in relational database management systems (RDBMS) that allows you to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

The `LEFT JOIN` keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matched records from the right table (table2). The result is NULL on the right side when there is no match.

## Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

- **table1**: The left table.
- **column_name(s)**: The column(s) you want to select.
- **table2**: The right table.
- **table1.column_name = table2.column_name**: The condition that connects the two tables.

## Example 1

Let's start with a basic example:

**Table "order"**

| order_id | customer_id | order_date            |
| -------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| 1        | 3           | `2020-07-04 12:34:56` |
| 2        | 1           | `2020-09-13 12:34:56` |
| 3        | 2           | `2020-10-09 12:34:56` |
| 4        | 5           | `2020-12-02 12:34:56` |

**Table "customer"**

| customer_id | name    | country |
| ----------- | ------- | ------- |
| 1           | John    | USA     |
| 2           | Michael | Germany |
| 3           | Sarah   | France  |
| 4           | Sally   | UK      |

We can find all orders, whether they have a matching customer or not, using the following query:

```sql
SELECT order.order_id, customer.name, customer.country
FROM order
LEFT JOIN customer
ON order.customer_id = customer.customer_id;
```

The result-set will look like this:

| order_id | name    | country |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| 1        | Sarah   | France  |
| 2        | John    | USA     |
| 3        | Michael | Germany |
| 4        | NULL    | NULL    |

The `order_id 4` has no matching `customer_id` in the Customers table, so it returns NULL.

## Example 2 - Joining More than Two Tables

Let's consider a new table called "product":

**Table "product"**

| product_id | product_name | price |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----- |
| 1          | Apple        | 1.00  |
| 2          | Banana       | 0.50  |
| 3          | Cherry       | 2.00  |

To get all orders, the customer who made the order, and the product bought, we can use a `LEFT JOIN` twice:

```sql
SELECT order.order_id, customer.name, product.product_name
FROM order
LEFT JOIN customer ON order.customer_id = customer.customer_id
LEFT JOIN product ON order.product_id = product.product_id;
```

The result-set will look like this:

| order_id | name    | product_name |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ |
| 1        | Sarah   | Apple        |
| 2        | John    | Banana       |
| 3        | Michael | Cherry       |
| 4        | NULL    | NULL         |

Here, Order 4 doesn't match with any customer or product, so it returns NULL in those fields.

## Example 3 - Using LEFT JOIN with WHERE Clause

You can also use the `

LEFT JOIN`clause with the`WHERE` clause to filter the records.

```sql
SELECT order.order_id, customer.name, customer.country
FROM order
LEFT JOIN customer
ON order.customer_id = customer.customer_id
WHERE customer.country = 'USA';
```

Result-set:

| order_id | name | country |
| -------- | ---- | ------- |
| 2        | John | USA     |

The result only includes orders from customers in the USA. Other orders, or orders with no matching customer in the USA, are not included in the result set.

## Example 4 - Using LEFT JOIN with Aggregate Functions

`LEFT JOIN` can also be used with aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, etc.

Let's say we want to count the number of orders each customer has made:

```sql
SELECT customer.name, COUNT(order.order_id) as number_of_orders
FROM customer
LEFT JOIN order
ON customer.customer_id = order.customer_id
GROUP BY customer.name;
```

Result-set:

| name    | number_of_orders |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| John    | 1                |
| Michael | 1                |
| Sarah   | 1                |
| Sally   | 0                |

This query groups the orders by customer names, and counts the number of orders each customer has made. Sally has not made any orders, so the NumberOfOrders is 0.
