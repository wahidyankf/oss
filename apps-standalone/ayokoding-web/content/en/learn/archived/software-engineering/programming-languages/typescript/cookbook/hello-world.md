```tsx
console.log('Hello World!'); // Output: Hello World!
```

Let's break this down:

1. `console.log()`: `console` is a global object provided by JavaScript environments such as web browsers or Node.js. The `log` method is a function on the `console` object that is used to print output. This output is typically sent to the standard output (`stdout`) which in a web browser is the JavaScript console.
2. `'Hello World!'`: This is a string literal, which is a series of characters surrounded by single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`). In this case, the string literal contains the text `Hello World!`.
3. `console.log('Hello World!')`: When this statement is executed, it will send the string `Hello World!` to the standard output. If this is a web browser, it would typically appear in the JavaScript console.
4. `// Output: Hello World!`: This is a comment in the code. In JavaScript and TypeScript, any text following `//` on a line is a comment, and it does not affect the execution of the code. It is used here to indicate the expected output of the `console.log` statement.

So, in summary:

- `console.log('Hello World!');` is a line of TypeScript/JavaScript code that outputs the string `'Hello World!'` to the console.
- `// Output: Hello World!` is a comment that documents the expected output of the previous line of code.
