üóíÔ∏è You can find the code [here](https://github.com/organiclever/ayokoding/tree/main/contents/dart-cookbook/dart-cookbook-primary/src/hello_world).

```dart
void main() {
  print("Hello World");
}
```

The provided Dart code is straightforward and does the following:

1. It defines the `main` function, the entry point for every Dart application. When the Dart runtime executes your application, it calls the `main` function first.
2. Inside the `main` function, the `print` function is invoked with the string "Hello World" as an argument.
3. The `print` function sends output to the console. In this case, it will output the text "Hello World".

So, when you run this program, it will simply print the text "Hello World" to the console.
