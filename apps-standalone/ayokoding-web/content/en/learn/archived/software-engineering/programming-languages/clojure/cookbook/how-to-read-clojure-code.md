Reading Clojure code is similar to reading any other language - you need to understand its basic structure, syntax, and idioms. But as a Lisp dialect, Clojure uses a syntax different from C-like languages. It is based around lists, represented by parentheses, where the first element of the list is usually a function or special operator and the rest are the arguments.

Here are some points to help you understand Clojure code:

1. **Data structures**: Clojure has several built-in data structures including lists, vectors, sets, and maps.
   - Lists are defined with parentheses e.g. `(1 2 3)`.
   - Vectors are defined with square brackets e.g. `[1 2 3]`.
   - Sets are defined with curly brackets and preceded with a hashtag e.g. `#{1 2 3}`.
   - Maps are defined with curly brackets and contain key-value pairs e.g. `{:a 1, :b 2}`.
2. **Functions and special forms**: In Clojure, code and data share the same structure. Functions and operators are invoked in prefix notation. That is, they come before their operands. For example, `(println "Hello, World!")` will print the string "Hello, World!" to the console.
3. **Defining values**: The `def` keyword is used to define a global var. For example, `(def pi 3.14)` defines a var named `pi` with a value of `3.14`.
4. **Defining functions**: Functions are defined with `defn`. For example, `(defn square (* x x))` defines a function named `square` that squares its argument.
5. **Conditionals**: `if` is used for conditional logic, and takes the form `(if test then else)`. For example, `(if (> x 0) x (- x))` returns the absolute value of `x`.
6. **Loops**: Clojure uses `loop` and `recur` for looping, although it also supports high-level constructs like `map`, `reduce`, `filter`, etc.
7. **Comments**: Comments start with a semicolon and go to the end of the line. For example: `; This is a comment`.
8. **Namespaces**: Namespaces are defined using `ns`. They're similar to modules in Python and packages in Java. For example, `(ns my.namespace)` would declare that the following code belongs to the `my.namespace` namespace.
9. **Nil, true, false**: `nil` is Clojure's null value. `true` and `false` are the boolean values.
10. **Keywords**: Keywords in Clojure are like keys in a map or enums in other languages, and are defined with a preceding colon, like `:keyword`.
11. **Sequences**: Many Clojure operations work on sequences (lists, vectors, sets, maps, etc.). There are many built-in functions for creating, manipulating, and querying sequences.
12. **Destructuring**: Clojure supports destructuring, which is a way to bind names to values in a data structure in a single operation.

Clojure has many more features, but these should give you a good start. Once you're comfortable with these, I recommend exploring the official Clojure documentation to learn about the language's more advanced features. Also, as with any language, practice is key! Writing your own Clojure code will help you become more comfortable with reading it.
