# FAQ

Scrum is a framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products, and it is designed to help teams work together more effectively. As such, questions may arise as teams implement the Scrum framework. This FAQ section aims to answer some commonly asked questions about Scrum.

## Estimation

### At what event should we estimate the effort of backlog items?

Product backlog items should be estimated during the sprint planning meeting. The development team should collaborate to create a plan for the sprint and estimate the effort required to complete each item in the product backlog. The team can estimate the effort by using techniques like planning poker, affinity estimating, or t-shirt sizing. The estimates help the team plan the sprint and determine how much work they can commit to completing during the sprint.

### How can we do the estimation?

You can see this section of Agile Software Development: [Estimation](../../project-management/estimation/)
