## What is Lean Software Development?

Lean software development is a way of making software that's a lot like building with Lego blocks. You start with a tiny piece and then add another piece, then another piece, until you've made something cool like a castle or a spaceship. The idea is not to make the whole castle at once but to make it a bit at a time and always check if the part you just added looks good and fits the other parts.

## Benefits and Downsides of Lean Software Development

### Benefits

1. **Less Waste**: Imagine if you made your Lego castle so that you had many extra pieces you didn't need. That would be a waste, wouldn't it? The same thing happens when you make software. Lean software development helps ensure that everything you build is needed and that you don't waste time building stuff you don't.
2. **Faster Feedback**: Just like how you would look at each Lego piece you add to see if it fits, in lean software development, you show the things you build to the people who will use it (like your friends) as soon as you can so that they can tell you if it's good or if it needs to be changed.
3. **Easy to Change**: If you build a Lego castle and realize you want to add a tower, it's easier to build it piece by piece. The same is valid for software. Lean development lets you change things quickly if you need to.

### Downsides

1. **Needs Good Communication**: Just like when you're playing a game with your friends, you need to talk to each other so you all know what you're doing. If you don't, things can get messy. The same is true for lean software development. You need to talk and listen to the people who will use the software, and that can be hard sometimes.
2. **Hard to Plan Ahead**: Imagine if you start building a Lego castle without knowing how big it should be or what it should look like. That could be a problem, right? The same is valid with lean software development. Because you're building piece by piece, sometimes it can be hard to know exactly what the final software will look like or how long it will take to build.
3. **Can Lead to Overworking**: Sometimes, when you're really into building your Lego castle, you might forget to take a break, and that's not good. The same can happen with lean software development. Because you're always trying to add new pieces and make improvements, sometimes people can work too hard and get tired.

## Further Reading

If you want to learn more about lean software development, some fabulous books, and websites can help. Remember, these might be hard to read because they're for grown-ups, but you can always ask a grown-up to help explain them!

1. [Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Software-Development-Agile-Toolkit/dp/0321150783) - This book by Mary and Tom Poppendieck is a great way to learn more about lean software development.
2. [The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/) - This website is about using lean thinking to make a successful business, but it also has lots of good stuff about lean software development.
