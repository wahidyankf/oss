# Kanban

## What is Kanban?

Imagine you're playing a game. You have a bunch of tasks, or let's say toys, and you need to play with one after another. You have a big toy box and three smaller boxes. The first small box is for the toys you're going to play with now, the second one is for the toys you're playing with now, and the third is for toys you have already played with.

Kanban is just like that game. We have tasks (like toys) that we move from one box (or stage) to another until we finish them.

## Benefits and Downsides of Kanban

### Benefits

Playing with toys individually makes it easier to focus and have fun, right? Kanban does the same. Here are some benefits:

1. **Better Focus**: You can concentrate on one task at a time. No more juggling!
2. **Visual**: You can see all your tasks and how they move, just like your toys in their boxes.
3. **Flexible**: If you suddenly want to play with a new toy, you can easily add it to your 'play now' box.

### Downsides

But, like any game, there might be some problems:

1. **Waiting**: If you're waiting for your sibling to finish playing with a toy, it can delay your fun.
2. **Overloading**: If you try to play with too many toys at once, you might get overwhelmed.
3. **Dependency**: If one toy (task) needs another toy (task) to be played with first, it can slow things down.
