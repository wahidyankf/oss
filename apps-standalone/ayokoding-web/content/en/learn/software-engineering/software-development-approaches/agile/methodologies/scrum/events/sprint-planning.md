# Sprint Planning

Sprint planning is a critical event in the Scrum framework, where the team comes together to plan and prepare for the upcoming Sprint. In this process, the team defines the sprint goal, selects the backlog items to be worked on, and creates a plan for accomplishing the selected work. Let's dive into the various aspects of Sprint planning:

## Goals

Sprint planning is a necessary process that helps a team to achieve their project goals effectively. It involves three key steps that are essential for project success. These steps are:

1. **Defining the Sprint Goal**: This is the first step of the sprint planning process, and it involves establishing a clear and concise goal for the Sprint. The goal provides direction and purpose for the team's work and helps ensure their efforts are focused and productive.
2. **Selecting Backlog Items**: Once the sprint goal has been defined, the team collaboratively selects the product backlog items that they will work on during the Sprint. This step is essential as it ensures the team works on the most critical items to help them achieve their sprint goal.
3. **Creating a Sprint Plan**: The final step in the sprint planning process is to create a detailed plan outlining how the team will achieve its sprint goal. This plan includes the tasks and activities required to complete the work and the timelines and resources needed. By creating a detailed plan, the team can effectively manage their time and resources and stay on track to achieve their sprint goal.

## Non-goals

While Sprint planning is a crucial part of the Scrum framework, it is essential to note that it has its limitations. While it is essential to focus on the goals mentioned above during Sprint planning, it is equally important to recognize that it does not aim to address the following:

1. **Detailed task breakdown**: While Sprint planning is essential for identifying major work items, it is not intended for a thorough breakdown of individual tasks. Discussing high-level tasks during Sprint planning can be helpful, but a more detailed task breakdown should be done outside this event.
2. **Technical implementation discussions**: While technical discussions are essential to any project, they should be held separately from Sprint planning. Sprint planning is intended for high-level planning and identifying major work items rather than for detailed technical discussions. However, it is essential to ensure that technical discussions occur at other appropriate times during the project.
3. **Stakeholder engagement**: While Sprint planning is essential for planning and setting goals, it is not intended to engage with stakeholders. Stakeholders should be engaged before or after the Sprint planning event to provide feedback and help ensure that the project is on track to meet their needs.

## Output

During this event, the team collaborates to establish the objectives and goals for the upcoming Sprint. The output of this event includes the following:

1. **Sprint Goa**l: The team collectively agrees upon a sprint goal that represents the purpose and desired outcome of the Sprint. The goal is a common thread guiding the team toward completing the Sprint.
2. **Selected Product Backlog Items**: The team must decide which backlog items to take up for the Sprint. The selection process is crucial as it directly affects the sprint goal and outcome. The team collectively decides which items will be taken up for the Sprint and brings them into the sprint backlog.
3. **Sprint Plan**: The team outlines the tasks and activities required to achieve the sprint goal. This plan serves as a guide throughout the Sprint, providing a framework for the team to work within. The plan outlines the tasks and activities required to achieve the sprint goal, including developing and testing software features and any other activities required to deliver a complete and functional product at the end of the Sprint.

## Attendees

A sprint planning event involves the following participants:

1. **Product Owner**: The Product Owner plays a critical role in the Sprint planning event. They provide insights into the product backlog items and clarify any questions from the Development Team. They are responsible for ensuring that the product backlog is prioritized and that the team is working on the most critical items first.
2. **Scrum Master**: The Scrum Master facilitates the Sprint planning event. They ensure that the process is followed and help keep the meeting productive. They work with the Scrum Team to identify and remove any impediments that may prevent the team from achieving their goals.
3. **Development Team**: The Development Team actively participates in the planning process. They ask questions, estimate the effort required for the backlog items, and identify any dependencies that must be addressed. They work with the Product Owner and Scrum Master to identify the items that will be included in the sprint backlog.

## Who leads it?

Facilitation is a crucial aspect of any Scrum team. It involves more than just leading the sprint planning event, as the facilitator works to make the Scrum process easier for the team. They help identify and resolve potential issues and risks, answer questions, and provide guidance.

The Scrum Master typically fulfills the role of facilitator, leading the sprint planning event and working with the Product Owner to ensure the team is working on the right things. Effective facilitators have excellent communication skills and build strong relationships with the team.

## Duration

The duration of Sprint planning depends on the length of the Sprint. As a guideline, the event is usually time-boxed to around 4 hours for a one-month sprint. This allows for sufficient time to establish the sprint goal, identify the work items and create a plan for the upcoming Sprint. However, for shorter sprints, the duration can be shorter, such as 1-2 hours. It is important to note that shorter sprints require a more focused and efficient planning process to identify and prioritize all necessary tasks.

In addition to the duration of the sprint planning event, it is also essential to consider the preparation time required beforehand. This may include reviewing Sprint's previous outcomes, analyzing team performance, and gathering stakeholder feedback. Adequate preparation time ensures that the team enters the planning meeting with a clear understanding of the sprint goal and the to achieve it.

## Preparation

To make the Sprint planning event successful, it is essential to take the following preparations into account:

1. **Refined Product Backlog**: The Product Owner should ensure the product backlog is refined and prioritized before the Sprint planning event. This includes having detailed and well-understood user stories or backlog items. Ensuring that the backlog items are correctly estimated, and the team clearly understands the priorities is also essential.
2. **Clear Definition of Ready**: The team should clearly understand the "Definition of Ready" for the backlog items. This includes clear acceptance criteria, dependencies identified, and a shared understanding of the items. In addition, it is essential to ensure that the team has a shared understanding of Sprint's overall goals and objectives.
3. **Team Capacity**: The Development Team should understand their capacity for the upcoming Sprint. This helps them select the appropriate amount of work and set realistic expectations. It is also essential for the team to have a clear understanding of individual roles and responsibilities and the project's overall goals. This can help ensure that everyone is working towards the same objectives and that the team can work effectively together.

## Procession

The Sprint planning event is a critical meeting in the Scrum framework that ensures a successful outcome for Sprint. It typically follows a sequence of steps essential to the Scrum process. Here is a detailed breakdown of each step:

1. **Setting the Context**: The Scrum Master starts the meeting by reminding the team of the sprint goal—this is the initial step in keeping the team aligned with the overall project objectives. The Scrum Master also reviews the progress from the previous Sprint, highlighting any areas that require attention, and provides any relevant updates.
2. **Product Backlog Review**: The Product Owner presents the highest-priority backlog items during this step. The Product Owner explains each item in detail, providing the necessary details and clarifications to the Development Team. This step is critical to ensure the Development Team understands the requirements clearly.
3. **Clarification and Questions**: The Development Team can seek clarification from the Product Owner during this step. This is an essential step in ensuring that everyone has a shared understanding of the backlog items. The Development Team can ask questions, discuss concerns, and provide input on completing the backlog items.
4. **Effort Estimation**: The Development Team estimates the effort required for each backlog item during this step. The team can use story points or relative sizing techniques to estimate the effort required. This step is critical to understand the work involved clearly.
5. **Selection of Backlog Items**: The Development Team collectively decides which backlog items they can commit to completing during the Sprint based on capacity and prioritization. This step ensures the team can complete the work within the sprint.
6. **Sprint Plan Creation**: The Development Team breaks down the selected backlog items into tasks and creates a plan for how they will accomplish the work. They may use visual aids like a sprint backlog or task board to organize and track their progress. This step is critical to ensure the team can complete the work within the sprint timeframe.
7. **Agreement and Commitment**: The entire Scrum Team discusses and agrees upon the sprint goal, selected backlog items, and the plan during this final step. Once everyone is aligned, the Sprint planning event concludes. This step is critical to ensure everyone is committed to the sprint goal and understands their role in achieving it.

## Tackling Technical Debt

When dealing with technical debt, it's essential to address it as soon as possible to avoid long-term consequences. During sprint planning, the team should carefully consider any existing issues or technical debt that could impact the product's quality. By allocating a portion of Sprint's capacity to address these issues, the team can prevent them from accumulating over time and impacting the product's performance. By tackling technical debt head-on, the team can improve the overall quality of the product and ensure that it meets the needs of its users. This can lead to greater customer satisfaction, increase tremendous engagement, and, ultimately, greater success for the product and the team behind it.

## Do's

Here are some best practices to keep in mind during Sprint planning:

1. **Collaboration**: Encourage active participation and collaboration among team members to gain a shared understanding of the work. This can be achieved through team-building exercises, open discussions, and regular check-ins to ensure everyone is on the same page.
2. **Focus on Value**: Prioritize backlog items that bring the most value to the product and align with the sprint goal. This means focusing on the key features that will make the product stand out rather than getting bogged down in minor details.
3. **Clear Sprint Goal**: Ensure the sprint goal is concise, well-defined, and understood by the entire team. This can be achieved through regular communication, clear documentation, and open feedback sessions.
4. **Time-Boxing**: Adhere to the time-boxed nature of the event, keeping discussions focused and within the allocated time. However, be sure to allow for some flexibility, as unexpected issues can arise that require additional discussion and problem-solving.

## Don'ts

Avoid the following pitfalls during Sprint planning:

1. **Micromanagement**: The Product Owner or any other team member should avoid dictating how tasks are to be accomplished. Trusting the Development Team's expertise in selecting and implementing their plan is essential. This allows the team to take ownership of their work and fosters a sense of pride and commitment toward the project.
2. **Overcommitment**: Avoid selecting excessive work that cannot be realistically completed within the Sprint. Be mindful of the team's capacity and the resources available for work; the team risks burnout and decrease by taking on too much-work morale. This can lead to a decline in productivity and quality of work.
3. **Skipping Preparation**: Failing to refine the product backlog or having a clear "Definition of Ready" can lead to inefficiencies and confusion during Sprint planning. It is essential to take the time to prepare appropriately for the Sprint, as this will help ensure a smooth and successful planning process. By refining the product backlog and establishing clear expectations for what is "ready," the team can work more efficiently toward their goals.
