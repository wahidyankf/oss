# Example for Engineering Manager

## **Review of Goals**

At the beginning of the performance period, I set the following goals for myself:

### **Goal 1: Lead the development of a new product feature**

To achieve this goal, I worked closely with our product team to identify a new feature opportunity and developed a plan for the development process. I led the team through the design, development, and launch phases, ensuring that the feature met our quality standards and was delivered on time.

**Result**: Successfully launched a new feature that increased user engagement by 20%.

### **Goal 2: Improve the performance of our web application by optimizing database queries**

To achieve this goal, I worked with our team to identify areas where we could improve the performance of our web application. I analyzed our database queries and proposed optimizations that would reduce the response time of our application. I then led the team through the implementation process, ensuring the optimizations were effective and not introducing new issues.

**Result**: Reduced the response time of our web application by 30%.

### **Goal 3: Develop a training program for our engineering team to improve their technical skills**

To achieve this goal, I worked with our HR team to develop a training program that covered vital technologies and best practices for software development. I then worked with our engineering team to implement the training program and provide guidance and support as needed.

**Result**: Increased our engineering team's technical skills and improved our code's quality.

## **Accomplishments**

In addition to achieving my goals, I also made significant contributions to our team's success. Here are some of my key accomplishments using the STAR method:

### **Feature Development**

**Situation**: Our team identified a new feature opportunity that required development from design to launch.

**Task**: Led the development of the new feature and ensured that it met our quality standards and was delivered on time.

**Action**: Worked closely with our product team to develop a plan for the development process. I led the team through the design, development, and launch phases, ensuring that the feature met our quality standards and was delivered on time.

**Result**: Successfully launched a new feature that increased user engagement by 20%.

### **Performance Optimization**

**Situation**: Our web application was experiencing slow response times.

**Task**: Improve the performance of our web application by optimizing database queries.

**Action**: Analyzed our database queries and proposed optimizations that would reduce the response time of our application. I led the team through the implementation process, ensuring the optimizations were practical and not introducing new issues.

**Result**: Reduced the response time of our web application by 30%.

### **Training Program Development**

**Situation**: Our engineering team needed to improve their technical skills.

**Task**: Develop a training program that covers key technologies and best practices for software development.

**Action**: Worked with our HR team to develop a training program that covered vital technologies and best practices for software development. I worked with our engineering team to implement the training program and provide guidance and support as needed.

**Result**: Increased our engineering team's technical skills and improved our code's quality.

## **Areas for Improvement**

While I am proud of my accomplishments, I recognize that there are areas where I can improve. Specifically, I need to work on delegating tasks more effectively and providing more opportunities for my team members to take on leadership roles.

To address this, I plan to work with my team to identify areas where they can take on more responsibility and provide them with the support and guidance they need to succeed.

## **Goals and Aspirations**

In the next performance period, I want to continue leading and mentoring my team. Specifically, I would like to:

### **Goal 1: Improve our project management process and ensure that projects are delivered on time and within budget**

I believe that effective project management is key to our team's success. To achieve this goal, I plan to work with our project managers to identify areas where we can improve our project management process and implement new tools and techniques to ensure that projects are delivered on time and within budget.

**Target**: Increase the on-time delivery rate of projects by 25%.

### **Goal 2: Develop a career development program for our engineering team**

I believe that providing our engineering team with opportunities for career development is critical to their success and growth within the company. I plan to work with our HR team to develop a career development program that covers critical skills and best practices for advancing to more senior roles to achieve this goal.

**Target**: Increase the retention rate of our engineering team by 20%.

### Goal 3: Improve our code review process and ensure that code quality is maintained

I believe that effective code review is critical to maintaining code quality and ensuring that our codebase is maintainable. To achieve this goal, I plan to work with our team to identify areas where we can improve our code review process and implement new tools and techniques to maintain code quality.

**Target**: Improve code quality by 20% and reduce the number of bugs in our code by 30%.

## Conclusion

Overall, I am proud of my accomplishments during this performance period and excited to continue leading and mentoring my team. I am committed to achieving my goals and contributing to the success of our projects. Thank you for the opportunity to provide this self-review.
