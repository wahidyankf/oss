# Example for Mid-Level Software Engineer

## **Review of Goals**

At the beginning of the performance period, I set the following goals for myself:

### **Goal 1: Develop a new feature for our web application**

To achieve this goal, I worked closely with our product team to identify a new feature opportunity and developed a plan for the development process. I contributed to the design, development, and launch phases, ensuring that the feature met our quality standards and was delivered on time.

Result: Successfully launched a new feature that increased user engagement by 15%.

### **Goal 2: Improve the performance of our API by optimizing database queries**

To achieve this goal, I worked with our team to identify areas where we could improve the performance of our API. I analyzed our database queries and proposed optimizations that would reduce the response time of our API. I then contributed to the implementation process, ensuring the optimizations were practical and not introducing new issues.

Result: Reduced the response time of our API by 20%.

### **Goal 3: Learn a new programming language and contribute to a project in that language**

I identified a new programming language relevant to our team's work to achieve this goal and learned it on time. I then contributed to a project in that language, working with a senior engineer to ensure my contributions met our quality standards.

Result: Successfully contributed to a project in a new programming language and gained valuable experience.

## **Accomplishments**

In addition to achieving my goals, I contributed significantly to our team's success. Here are some of my key accomplishments using the STAR method:

### **Feature Development**

**Situation**: Our team identified a new feature opportunity that required development from design to launch.

**Task**: Contribute to developing the new feature and ensure that it meets our quality standards and is delivered on time.

**Action**: Worked closely with our product team to develop a plan for the development process. Contributed to the design, development, and launch phases, ensuring that the feature met our quality standards and was delivered on time.

**Result**: Successfully launched a new feature that increased user engagement by 15%.

### **Performance Optimization**

**Situation**: Our API was experiencing slow response times.

**Task**: Improve the performance of our API by optimizing database queries.

**Action**: Analyzed our database queries and proposed optimizations that would reduce the response time of our API. Contributed to the implementation process, ensuring the optimizations were effective and did not introduce new issues.

**Result**: Reduced the response time of our API by 20%.

### **Learning a New Programming Language**

**Situation**: Our team was exploring a new programming language relevant to our work.

**Task**: Learn the new programming language and contribute to a project in that language.

**Action**: Identified resources to learn the new programming language independently. Contributed to a project in that language, working with a senior engineer to ensure that my contributions met our quality standards.

**Result**: Successfully contributed to a project in a new programming language and gained valuable experience.

## **Areas for Improvement**

While I am proud of my accomplishments, I recognize that there are areas where I can improve. Specifically, I need to improve my time management skills and take more initiative in identifying areas where I can contribute to the team.

To address this, I plan to prioritize my tasks more effectively and proactively seek opportunities to contribute to the team's projects.

## **Goals and Aspirations**

In the next performance period, I want to continue developing my skills and contribute to our team's success. Specifically, I would like to:

### **Goal 1: Improve my understanding of software architecture and design patterns**

I believe that having a solid understanding of software architecture and design patterns is vital to developing high-quality software. I plan to read books and articles on software architecture and design patterns to achieve this goal and apply my learning to our team's projects.

**Target**: Improve my understanding of software architecture and design patterns and apply them to our team's projects.

### **Goal 2: Contribute to the development of a new product feature**

I believe that contributing to developing a new product feature is a valuable learning experience and an opportunity to contribute to the team's success significantly. I plan to work closely with our product team to identify a new feature opportunity and contribute to the development process to achieve this goal.

**Target**: Successfully contribute to developing a new product feature that meets our quality standards and is delivered on time.

### Goal 3: Mentor junior developers and help them improve their technical skills

I believe mentoring a junior developer is a valuable experience that allows me to share my knowledge and contribute to the growth of our team. To achieve this goal, I plan to identify a junior developer on our team who would benefit from guidance and support and work with them to identify areas where they need improvement.

**Target**: Successfully mentor junior developers and help them improve their technical skills.

## Conclusion

Overall, I am proud of my accomplishments during this performance period and am excited to continue to develop my skills and contribute to our team's success. I am committed to achieving my goals and contributing to the success of our projects. Thank you for the opportunity to provide this self-review.
