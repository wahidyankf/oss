# How to Create Great Peer Review

Peer reviews are an essential part of performance reviews. They provide valuable feedback to employees and help managers make informed decisions about promotions, raises, and other career development opportunities. However, creating great peer reviews can be challenging. This article will discuss tips for creating effective peer reviews to help your team members grow and develop.

### **1. Be Specific**

When writing a peer review, being specific about the employee's strengths and weaknesses is essential. Avoid general statements like "they are a good team player" or "they need to improve their communication skills." Instead, please provide specific examples of how the employee has demonstrated their strengths or areas where they could improve. For example, "they consistently go above and beyond to help their team members, such as staying late to finish a project," or "they could benefit from taking a more active role in team meetings to ensure everyone is on the same page."

### **2. Use Data**

Using data to support your feedback can make your peer review more objective and credible. For example, if you're reviewing a salesperson, you could include data on their sales performance, such as the number of deals closed or the revenue generated. If you're examining a developer, you could consist of data on their code quality or the number of bugs they've fixed. Using data can help the employee understand where they stand and what they need to do to improve.

### **3. Be Constructive**

Peer reviews should be constructive and focused on helping employees grow and develop. Avoid being overly critical or negative, as this can demotivate the employee and damage your relationship. Instead, focus on providing feedback that is actionable and specific. For example, instead of saying, "You need to improve your time management skills," you could say, "You could benefit from creating a prioritization system to ensure you're focusing on the most important tasks first."

### **4. Be Timely**

Timeliness is crucial when it comes to peer reviews. Providing feedback promptly allows the employee to take action and make improvements quickly. Delaying feedback can lead to missed opportunities for growth and development. Ideally, peer reviews should be conducted regularly, such as quarterly or bi-annually.

### **5. Be Balanced**

When writing a peer review, it's essential to be balanced and provide feedback on strengths and weaknesses. Focusing only on weaknesses can demotivate the employee while focusing only on strengths can lead to complacency. Giving feedback on both areas allows the employee to understand where they excel and where they need to improve.
