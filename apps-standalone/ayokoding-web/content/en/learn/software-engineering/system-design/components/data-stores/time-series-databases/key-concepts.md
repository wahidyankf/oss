# Key Concepts

Time series databases (TSDBs) are optimized for handling time-stamped or time-series data. They are designed to handle large volumes of data generated over time, such as sensor data, log data, financial data, and other time-dependent data types. This article will discuss the fundamental concepts of time series databases.

## **Time Series Data**

Time series data is a sequence of data points that are collected at regular intervals over time. Each data point is associated with a timestamp that indicates when the data was collected. Time series data can be univariate or multivariate. Univariate time series data consists of a single variable measured over time, while multivariate time series data consists of multiple variables measured over time.

Various sources, including sensors, IoT devices, financial systems, and social media platforms, generate time series data. The data is often generated in real-time and can be used to monitor and analyze various systems and processes.

## **Time Series Databases**

Time series databases are databases that are optimized for handling time series data. They are designed to handle large volumes of data generated over time, such as sensor data, log data, financial data, and other time-dependent data types. Time series databases are optimized for storing, querying, and analyzing time series data.

Time series databases are used in various applications, including monitoring and analyzing IoT, financial, and social media platforms. They are also used in scientific research, where they are used to analyze data from experiments and simulations.

## **Key Concepts of Time Series Databases**

### **Time Series Data Model**

The time series data model is the way that time series data is organized and stored in a time series database. The time series data model typically consists of a timestamp, one or more values, and optional tags or metadata. The timestamp is used to identify when the data was collected, the values represent the data collected, and the tags or metadata provide additional information about the data.

The time series data model is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing it to handle a wide range of time series data. The model can be customized to meet the specific needs of different applications and systems.

## **Time Series Data Ingestion**

Time series data ingestion is collecting and storing time series data in a time series database. Time series data can be ingested in real-time or in batches. Real-time ingestion involves collecting and storing data as it is generated, while batch ingestion involves collecting and storing data at regular intervals.

Time series data ingestion is a critical component of time series databases. It is essential to ensure that the data is ingested promptly and accurately to ensure that it is available for analysis and monitoring.

### **Time Series Data Querying**

Time series data querying is retrieving data from a time series database. Time series data can be queried using various techniques, including time-based, range, and aggregation queries. Time-based queries retrieve data for a specific time range, range queries retrieve data for a specific value range, and aggregation queries retrieve aggregated data for a specific time range.

Time series data querying is an essential component of time series databases. It allows users to retrieve and analyze data in real time, providing insights into system performance and behavior.

### **Time Series Data Analysis**

Time series data analysis analyzes data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies. Time series data analysis can be performed using various techniques, including statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

Time series data analysis is a critical component of time series databases. It allows users to monitor and analyze system performance and behavior, identify potential issues, and make informed decisions.
