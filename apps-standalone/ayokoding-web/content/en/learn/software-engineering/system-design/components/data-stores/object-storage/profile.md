## **Introduction**

Object storage is a type of data storage architecture that manages data as objects rather than as blocks or files. These objects are stored in a flat address space and can be accessed through a unique identifier. Object storage is designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data. It is often used in cloud-based applications, backup and archiving systems, and other applications that require high scalability and durability.

## **Key Characteristics**

- Object-based data model
- No fixed schema
- Support for unstructured data
- High scalability and durability
- Eventual consistency
- Automatic sharding and replication

## **CAP Theorem**

### **General CAP theorem handling**

Object storage is designed to prioritize availability and partition tolerance over consistency, making it a good fit for applications that require high availability and durability.

### **Guarantee of consistency**

Object storage typically provides eventual consistency, which means that updates to the database may take some time to propagate to all nodes in the system. Some databases also offer strong consistency, ensuring that all nodes see the same data simultaneously.

### **Guarantee of availability**

Object storage is designed to prioritize availability, which means it can continue operating even if some nodes in the system fail.

### **Guarantee of partition tolerance**

Object storage is designed to be highly scalable and handle large amounts of data across multiple nodes. It uses automatic sharding and replication to ensure that data is distributed evenly across the system and that it can continue operating even if some nodes fail.

## **Usage**

### **Best usage**

Object storage is well-suited for applications that require high scalability and durability with unstructured data, such as cloud-based applications, backup and archiving systems, and content distribution networks.

### **Neutral usage**

Object storage can also be used for applications that require semi-structured or structured data but may not be the best choice for applications that require strict consistency or complex transactions.

### **Worst usage**

Object storage may not be the best choice for applications that require complex joins or transactions or for applications that require strict consistency.

### **System Design Role**

Object storage is well-suited for systems that require high scalability and durability, such as distributed systems and cloud-based applications.

## **Data Model**

- Object-based data model
- Non-relational database
- Advantages: flexible data model, ability to store unstructured data, good performance with large datasets
- Disadvantages: may not be suitable for applications that require strict consistency or complex transactions

## **Query Language**

- NoSQL query language (e.g., Amazon S3 API)
- Advantages: simple, easy to use, good performance with large datasets
- Disadvantages: it may not be as powerful as SQL for complex queries

## **Scalability**

### **How to make it performant**

Object storage can be made performant through indexing and other performance optimization techniques.

### **High traffic handling**

Object storage is well-suited for high-read and high-write workloads but may require additional data partitioning and replication considerations.

### **How to scale it**

Object storage can be scaled horizontally through automatic sharding and replication.

### **Usage in distributed systems**

Object storage can be used in distributed systems but may require additional data partitioning and replication considerations.

### Replication

Object storage typically uses automatic replication to ensure data availability and durability. Best practices for replication include using a replication factor of at least three and ensuring that replicas are distributed across multiple data centers.

## In Practice

### Best Practices

- Use indexing and other performance optimization techniques to improve query performance.
- Use a replication factor of at least three to ensure data availability and durability.
- Monitor the system for performance issues and adjust as necessary.

### Common Pitfalls

- Not understanding the data model and how it affects query performance
- Not properly configuring replication and sharding
- Not monitoring the system for performance issues

### Examples

- Amazon S3
- Google Cloud Storage
- Microsoft Azure Blob Storage
