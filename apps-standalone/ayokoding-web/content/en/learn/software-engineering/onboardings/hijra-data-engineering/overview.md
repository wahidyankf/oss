## Introduction

The **Data Engineering Onboarding Curriculum** is a 70-chapter program transforming programmers into proficient data engineers, tailored for Hijra Group’s ecosystem. It emphasizes PostgreSQL, BigQuery, SQLite, Kubernetes (with Helm Charts), Airflow, dbt, Django, and FastAPI for building robust, testable data pipelines, web UIs, and APIs, aligning with Hijra Group’s needs for scalable analytics and containerized deployments using Uvicorn. Structured for ~52-minute sessions, it features eleven phases with checkpoints (Chapters 6, 11, 18, 24, 30, 37, 44, 51, 59, 66) and micro-projects for practical application, with all Python code after Chapter 7 using type annotations verified by Pyright and tested using `unittest` and/or `pytest` after Chapter 9. The curriculum is designed to be followed in a development environment, with setup instructions to be provided in chapter implementations. **Appendix 1: Required Data Files** provides essential datasets (e.g., `sales.csv`, `transactions.csv`, `sales.db`) for micro-projects and exercises, ensuring consistent seeding of financial transaction data for hands-on learning.

This curriculum equips learners to handle financial transaction data analytics via production-ready pipelines and web interfaces, culminating in capstone projects integrating security, observability, and scalability, with quality built-in from early type safety and testing.

### Prerequisite Guide

The curriculum assumes basic programming (variables, loops, functions), command-line skills, and familiarity with Python files for organizing code. For Hijra Group learners needing a refresher, recommended resources (~10–20 hours) include:

- **Python Basics**: Codecademy’s “Learn Python 3” or freeCodeCamp’s Python course.
- **Command-Line Skills**: LinuxCommand.org or shell command tutorials.
- **Data Structures**: Coursera’s “Python Data Structures” for lists, dictionaries, sets.
- **Web Fundamentals**: freeCodeCamp’s REST API tutorial for HTTP, REST, and MVC concepts.
- **Kubernetes Basics**: Kubernetes.io’s introductory tutorials for container orchestration and Helm.

**Development Environment**: Learners should prepare a development environment with Python 3.10+, a code editor (e.g., VS Code), and necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, psycopg2-binary, google-cloud-bigquery, apache-airflow, dbt-core, fastapi, uvicorn, djangorestframework, pyyaml, pytest, hypothesis). Install tools like PostgreSQL, Docker Desktop, and Google Cloud SDK for database, containerization, and cloud tasks. A virtual environment is recommended to manage dependencies, using `pip` for library installation. Detailed setup instructions will be provided in chapter implementations. **Appendix 1: Required Data Files** must be reviewed to create the `de-onboarding/data/` directory and populate it with required datasets (e.g., `sales.csv`, `config.yaml`, `sales.db`) as specified for micro-projects and exercises. Follow the appendix’s instructions to ensure files are correctly formatted and placed to avoid errors like `FileNotFoundError` during script execution.
