## Introduction: Learning Progression

This curriculum follows a carefully designed learning path to build data engineering skills progressively. Each section provides just enough knowledge for the next, creating a smooth learning journey from basic concepts to advanced techniques.

The curriculum begins with Python fundamentals and gradually introduces database systems from simplest (SQLite) to more complex (PostgreSQL) to specialized analytical systems (BigQuery). Python integration with each system follows the same pattern, ensuring you learn just what you need when you need it.

Each section builds on previous knowledge, with practical micro-projects that reinforce learning while delivering immediate value. As you progress through the curriculum, you'll develop a comprehensive set of data engineering skills applicable to real-world scenarios.

The learning journey follows a logical progression through several major phases:

1. **Foundation Building (Chapters 1-9):** Establishing core programming and database skills with Python and SQLite.
2. **Production Database Systems (Chapters 10-13):** Moving to enterprise-grade databases with PostgreSQL.
3. **Analytical Systems (Chapters 14-18):** Expanding to data warehousing and analytical capabilities with BigQuery.
4. **Advanced Processing & Development (Chapters 19-28):** Deepening data processing skills and introducing visualization.
5. **Orchestration & Operations (Chapters 29-40):** Learning to automate, deploy, and maintain data systems at scale.
6. **Advanced Development & Capstone Projects (Chapters 41-43):** Applying technical skills through comprehensive capstone projects that integrate multiple aspects of the curriculum.

Each phase builds naturally on the previous one, and transition sections explicitly connect concepts across the curriculum to create a cohesive learning experience.

## Self-Assessment Framework

To help you gauge your understanding and readiness to progress, we've included knowledge checks at the end of each major section. These self-assessments are designed to verify that you've mastered the key concepts before moving to more advanced topics.

### How to Use the Self-Assessments

1. Complete the knowledge check questions at the end of each major section
2. If you can answer at least 80% of the questions correctly, you're ready to move on
3. For any areas where you struggle, review the relevant chapters before proceeding
4. Use the self-assessments as a study guide when revisiting topics

The self-assessments are not meant to be stressful evaluations but rather helpful tools to reinforce learning and identify any knowledge gaps that need attention before building on those foundations.
