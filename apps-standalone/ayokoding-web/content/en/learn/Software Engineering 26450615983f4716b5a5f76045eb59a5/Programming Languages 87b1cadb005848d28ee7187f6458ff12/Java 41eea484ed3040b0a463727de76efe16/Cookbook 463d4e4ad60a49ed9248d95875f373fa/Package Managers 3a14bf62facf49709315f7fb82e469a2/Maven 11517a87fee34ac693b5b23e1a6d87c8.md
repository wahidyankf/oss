# Maven

Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. It is designed to simplify the build process and manage dependencies. Maven uses a declarative approach to build configuration, meaning developers only need to specify what they want to build, and Maven takes care of the rest.

## Key Concepts

### Project Object Model (POM)

The POM is an XML file that contains information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project. It includes information such as project dependencies, plugins, and build profiles.

### Dependency Management

Maven manages project dependencies by downloading them from a central repository. Developers can specify the dependencies in the POM file, and Maven will automatically download and manage them.

### Plugins

Maven plugins are used to extend the build process. They can be used to perform tasks such as compiling code, running tests, and packaging the project.

### Build Lifecycle

The Maven build lifecycle consists of a series of phases, each representing a stage in the build process. The default lifecycle includes phases such as compile, test, package, and install.

## Examples

### Creating a New Maven Project

To create a new Maven project, you can use the `mvn archetype:generate` command. This will prompt you to select an archetype, a template for the project structure. Once you have selected an archetype, Maven will generate a new project with the specified structure.

### Building a Project

To build a Maven project, you can use the `mvn package` command. This will compile the code, run tests, and package the project into a JAR or WAR file.

### Managing Dependencies

You can add project dependencies to the POM file using the `<dependencies>` element to manage project dependencies. Maven will automatically download and manage the dependencies when you build the project.
