## **Summary**

"First, Break All the Rules" is a management book by Marcus Buckingham and Curt Coffman. The book is based on extensive research conducted by the Gallup Organization, which studied over 80,000 managers across different industries and organizations.

The authors argue that great managers do not follow conventional wisdom or best practices; instead, they break the rules and create their own unique management style. They identified 12 critical questions that great managers ask themselves and their employees to create a high-performing team. These questions include:

1. Do I know what is expected of me at work?
2. Do I have the materials and equipment to do my work right?
3. At work, do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day?
4. Have I received recognition or praise for doing good work in the last seven days?
5. Does my supervisor, or someone at work, seem to care about me?
6. Is there someone at work who encourages my development?
7. At work, do my opinions seem to count?
8. Does the mission/purpose of my company make me feel my job is important?
9. Are my co-workers committed to doing quality work?
10. Do I have a best friend at work?
11. Has someone at work told me about my progress in the last six months?
12. Have I had opportunities at work this last year to learn and grow?

The authors also emphasize the importance of focusing on employees' strengths rather than trying to fix their weaknesses. They argue that great managers help their employees develop their natural talents and abilities, which leads to higher engagement, productivity, and job satisfaction.

Overall, "First, Break All the Rules" provides a fresh perspective on management and offers practical advice for creating a high-performing team.
