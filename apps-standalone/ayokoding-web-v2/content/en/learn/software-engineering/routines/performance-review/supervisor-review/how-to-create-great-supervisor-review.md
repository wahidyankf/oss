# How to Create Great Supervisor Review

A supervisor review is an essential part of the performance review process. It provides an opportunity for managers to evaluate their employees' performance, provide feedback, and set goals for the future. A well-written supervisor review can help employees understand their strengths and weaknesses, identify areas for improvement, and develop a plan for professional growth. This article will discuss creating an excellent supervisor review for performance review.

### **1. Start with the basics**

Review the employee's work history, including previous performance reviews, to understand their strengths and weaknesses. Before writing the review, ensure you have all the necessary information. This includes the employee's job description, performance goals, and relevant metrics or data.

### **2. Be specific**

When writing the review, be clear about the employee's performance. Use concrete examples to illustrate your points. For example, instead of saying, "John is a good communicator," say, "John consistently communicates clearly and effectively with his team members, which has helped to improve collaboration and productivity."

### **3. Focus on results**

When evaluating the employee's performance, focus on outcomes rather than activities. For example, instead of saying, "Sara attended all of the team meetings," say, "Sara's contributions in team meetings helped to generate new ideas and improve project outcomes."

### **4. Provide constructive feedback**

While it's important to highlight the employee's strengths, providing constructive feedback on areas where they can improve is equally essential. Be specific about what the employee needs to do to improve, and provide resources or support to help them achieve their goals.

### **5. Set goals for the future**

The supervisor review is an opportunity to set goals for the future. Please work with the employee to identify areas where they can improve and set specific, measurable goals to help them achieve their objectives. Ensure the goals are realistic and achievable, and provide support and resources to help the employee succeed.
