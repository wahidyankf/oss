# Python Functional Programming Demo

This comprehensive demonstration covers:

1. Core functional programming concepts in Python
2. Built-in functions (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)
3. Comparison with list comprehensions
4. Immutable data structures
5. Pure functions

## Key Features Demonstrated

### Functional Built-ins

- `map()` for transformations
- `filter()` for sequence filtering
- `reduce()` for aggregation

### Alternative Approaches

- List comprehensions vs functional style
- Generator expressions
- Readability comparisons

### Functional Principles

- Immutable data structures (tuples, frozensets)
- Pure functions (no side effects)
- Function composition

## How to Run

1. Execute the demo script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Observe the output demonstrating:
   - Functional operations
   - Immutability examples
   - Pure function behavior
3. Experiment by modifying:
   - The sample data structures
   - The operation pipelines
   - The function compositions

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this demo, you will understand:

- When to use functional programming constructs
- How to work with immutable data
- The benefits of pure functions
- Performance and readability tradeoffs
