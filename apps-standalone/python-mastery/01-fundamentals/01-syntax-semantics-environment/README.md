# Python Syntax & Environment Basics

This directory demonstrates fundamental Python syntax and environment setup.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

1. **Dynamic Typing** (variables can change type)
2. **Indentation-based Blocks** (vs braces in other languages)
3. **Naming Conventions** (snake_case for variables/functions)
4. **Basic Syntax Elements** (comments, print statements)
5. **Environment Setup** (Python installation, IDE configuration)

## How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```

## Key Takeaways

- Python uses dynamic typing and strong typing
- Proper indentation is mandatory for code blocks
- Following naming conventions improves code readability
- Setting up a proper development environment is crucial
