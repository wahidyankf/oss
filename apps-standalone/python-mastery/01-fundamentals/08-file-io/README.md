# Python File I/O Masterclass

## Overview

This heavily commented Python script (`main.py`) demonstrates best practices for file operations in Python, covering both basic and advanced techniques with an emphasis on safety, reliability, and cross-platform compatibility.

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Basic File Operations

- Reading/writing text files (`'r'`, `'w'` modes)
- Context managers (`with open()`) for automatic cleanup
- Proper file encoding (UTF-8 by default)
- File object methods (`read()`, `write()`, `readlines()`)

### 2. Advanced File Handling

- Binary file operations (`'rb'`, `'wb'` modes)
- Modern path handling with `pathlib.Path`
- Directory operations (create, list, remove)
- Temporary files and cleanup patterns

### 3. Error Handling

- Common file exceptions (`FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionError`)
- Custom exception classes for application errors
- Exception chaining for debugging
- Graceful fallback strategies

### 4. Best Practices

1. **Resource Management**

   - Always use context managers
   - Explicit file encoding
   - Proper cleanup procedures

2. **Path Handling**

   - Prefer `pathlib` over `os.path`
   - Cross-platform path construction
   - Path validation checks

3. **Error Recovery**

   - Specific exception handling
   - Meaningful error messages
   - Safe retry patterns

4. **Performance**
   - Buffered vs unbuffered I/O
   - Chunked reading for large files
   - Memory-efficient processing

## How to Run

1. Execute the demo script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. The script will:
   - Create and delete temporary files
   - Demonstrate various I/O operations
   - Show proper error handling
3. Observe console output for operation results

## Learning Outcomes

By studying this module, you will:

- Master Python's file I/O system
- Handle files safely across platforms
- Implement robust error handling
- Apply modern path manipulation
- Write efficient file processing code

## Implementation Details

The demo script includes:

1. Comprehensive examples for each concept
2. Interactive demonstrations
3. Real-world use cases
4. Clear output formatting

For deeper understanding, examine:

- Context manager implementation
- Pathlib usage patterns
- Custom exception design
- Resource cleanup strategies
