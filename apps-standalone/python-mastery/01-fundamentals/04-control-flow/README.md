# Python Control Flow Masterclass

## Overview

This heavily commented Python script (`main.py`) provides a comprehensive demonstration of Python's core control flow structures. It serves as both a learning resource and practical reference for directing program execution flow.

## Control Flow Structures

### 1. Conditional Statements (`if`/`elif`/`else`)

- Execute different code blocks based on boolean conditions
- Handle multiple mutually exclusive conditions
- Nested conditionals for complex logic
- Truthy/falsy evaluation of values

### 2. `for` Loops

- Iterate over sequences (lists, strings, ranges, etc.)
- `enumerate()` for accessing both index and value
- `zip()` for parallel iteration
- `else` clause executes after normal completion

### 3. `while` Loops

- Execute while condition remains `True`
- Requires careful condition management
- `else` clause executes after normal completion
- Common patterns (counters, input validation)

### 4. Loop Control Statements

- `break`: Immediate loop termination
- `continue`: Skip to next iteration
- `pass`: Null statement placeholder

### 5. Special Cases

- List comprehensions (loop alternatives)
- Ternary expressions (`x if cond else y`)
- Chained comparisons (`1 < x < 10`)

## Key Concepts

- **Indentation**: Critical for block scope definition
- **Condition Evaluation**: Truthy/falsy values
- **Loop Management**: Controlling iteration flow
- **Loop Completion**: Using `else` with loops
- **Code Organization**: Structuring control flow clearly

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the directory
2. Execute:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. The script demonstrates:
   - Conditional logic examples
   - Loop behaviors
   - Control statements
   - Special cases

## Learning Outcomes

By studying this module, you will:

- Master all Python control flow structures
