# Python Control Flow Documentation

This module demonstrates Python's control flow structures with comprehensive examples.

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Conditional Statements

- if/elif/else chains
- Truthy/falsy evaluation
- Nested conditionals

### 2. For Loops

- Iterating over sequences
- Using enumerate()
- The else clause

### 3. While Loops

- Condition-based iteration
- Avoiding infinite loops
- The else clause

### 4. Loop Control

- break: Early loop termination
- continue: Skipping iterations
- pass: Placeholder statement

### 5. Special Cases

- List comprehensions (alternative to loops)
- Ternary expressions (alternative to simple if/else)

## How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```

## Expected Output

The demo will show:

- Example control flow structures
- Clear output formatting
- Explanatory comments

## Learning Objectives

- Understand all control flow structures
- Learn when to use each type
- Recognize common patterns
- Identify potential pitfalls
