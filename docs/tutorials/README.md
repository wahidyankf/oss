# Tutorials

**Learning-oriented guides** that take you by the hand through a series of steps to learn new concepts.

## What are Tutorials?

Tutorials are lessons that guide newcomers through their first steps with the project. They:

- Assume no prior knowledge
- Provide complete, working examples
- Focus on learning, not achieving real goals
- Build confidence through hands-on practice

Think of tutorials as teaching someone to cook their first meal - you guide them through each step, explain what they're doing, and ensure they end up with something that works.
