# Reference

**Information-oriented descriptions** providing technical details about the system.

## What is Reference Documentation?

Reference documentation is like a dictionary or encyclopedia. It:

- Describes the system objectively
- Is organized for quick lookup
- Provides complete, accurate information
- Focuses on facts, not tasks

Think of reference docs as a map - they show you what exists and where to find it, but don't tell you where to go.
